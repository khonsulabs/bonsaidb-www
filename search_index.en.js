is a developer-friendly database for the Rust programming\nlanguage that grows with you and your projects.\nA developer-friendly database should be able to solve most of your data storage\nand transmission needs. The features BonsaiDb offers are catered to solving some\nof the most common problems developers face when creating connected, data-driven\napplications.\nBonsaiDb's Features\n\n\n    It grows with you\n    \n\nBonsaiDb's features are designed to work when using it as a local-only database,\nas a networked database server, and eventually as a distributed\ncluster. This design makes it easy to test and develop apps with\nBonsaiDb, as there is no additional software for developers to set up when\nworking on a BonsaiDb powered app.\n\n\n    Schema as Rust Code\n    \n\nBonsaiDb leverages the Rust type system to define schema as code, enabling the\nRust compiler to help you ensure your database code is correct. This helps keep\nthe likelihood of unexpected runtime errors to a minimum, and it also helps\ndevelopers understand the entire flow of their code and data.\n\n\n    ACID-compliant Transactional Storage\n    \n\nBonsaiDb's collections are ACID-compliant, giving you the\npeace of mind that your data is safe in the event of an unexpected failure of\nthe server. This mode of storage should be the default for most developers, yet\nmany popular NoSQL database choices do not offer ACID-compliant storage.\nAn example of where ACID-compliance matters: Storing a customer's order in a web\nstore. If the method of writing the customer's order to the database is not\nACID-compliant, a power failure could occur between saving the customer's order\nand the bytes being persisted to disk. This could result in a user being\nnotified that their order was successfully submitted (and worse, their credit\ncard charged), yet after the power is restored, your database has no record of\nthe transaction.\n\n\n    Competitive Performance\n    \n\nBonsaiDb does not aim to be the fastest database available. Instead, our focus\nis on developer experience and data reliability. However, we recognize the\nimportance of trusting that BonsaiDb is able perform as well as existing\ndatabase solutions and aim to provide competitive performance. To see how\nBonsaiDb currently compares, check out our benchmarks.\n\n\n    At-Rest Encryption\n    \n\nBonsaiDb optionally supports encrypting data at-rest,\nwhich prevents data from being leaked if a hard drive is stolen or wasn't wiped\nbefore being removed from a data center. This is an important feature to have\nwhen storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) if your hosting\nenvironment does not offer ways of encrypting the filesystem itself.\n\n\n    Backup / Restore\n    \n\nBonsaiDb offers backup and restore from a backup location,\nwhich is a trait that can be implemented for custom backup solutions. BonsaiDb\nprovides built-in support for using a filesystem directory as a backup location,\nand there is planned support for any S3-compatible storage service.\nCurrently, backups are always complete backups, but incremental backups are\nplanned.\n\n\n    Extensible Role-based Access Control\n    \n\nBonsaiDb offers a robust permission system which allows for\n\"actions\" to be allowed or denied on \"resources.\" BonsaiDb uses this access\ncontrol system internally, but it is written to be able to be extended by\nactions and resources defined in your application.\nWith BonsaiDb, you can choose to utilize the multi-user support as your account\nsystem for your application. By doing this, you can use roles and groups to\nmanage your application's permissions, not just the database's permissions.\nThis feature is still under development, and currently, permissions are only\nenforced at the network level. There are plans to allow permissions to be\nevaluated offline as well.\n\n\n    Atomic Key-Value Storage\n    \n\nSometimes ACID compliance is overkill, such as in situations where a value is\nbeing updated hundreds or thousands of times per second. BonsaiDb offers a\nnamespaced, atomic key-value store. It currently offers basic\natomic operations as well as some atomic arithmetic operations.\nThe default configuration of the Key-Value store prefers data integrity, but\ncan be configured to allow better throughput.\n\n\n    Publish/Subscribe (PubSub)\n    \n\nBonsaiDb offers the ability to subscribe to topics and receive published\nmessages. PubSub can be used to power features like private messaging\nbut can also be used as a way to separate services within an application's\narchitecture.\n\n\n    Secure Networked Access\n    \n\nBonsaiDb offers two wire protocol implementations, one that utilizes\nQUIC and one that utilizes WebSockets. The QUIC-based\nprotocol is more efficient, but to enable access in the web browser, WebSockets\nare also offered. WebSockets may eventually be replaced or supplemented with a\nWebRTC offering.\n\n\n    Extensible Wire Protocol\n    \n\nBonsaiDb offers an ability to extend the wire protocol with a request/response\nstyle API. This provides an easy way to provide authenticated, permission-aware\naccess to server-side functionality.\nThe user's guide has a page dedicated to an example of this setup.\n\n\n    Extensible TCP Layer\n    \n\nSuppose you're designing an app that exposes an HTTP layer and wish to connect\nto your database server over WebSockets. BonsaiDb allows upgrading TCP\nconnections using a hyper::Request or manually after\nperforming the negotation.\nAn example of this configuration is included in the repository.\nIt shows how to use the Axum framework alongside BonsaiDb's WebSockets.\n\n\n    TLS Certificates via LetsEncrypt\n    \n\nBonsaiDb requires TLS for its connections. You can use any valid TLS\ncertificate. If you would like BonsaiDb to automatically acquire one using ACME,\nit's as simple as enabling a feature flag and listening for TCP connections on\nport 443. An example showing how this is configured is available\nin the repository.\n\n\n    BonsaiDb's Planned Features\n    \n\n\n\nPersistent Job Queue: BonsaiDb needs to run some tasks on a\nscheduled basis, and this schedule should be able to be adjusted by end users.\nAdditionally, it's not uncommon for developers to need to run jobs on a\nperiodic basis. By hosting these jobs in the database, it enables a\ncentralized location for monitoring these jobs. The goal of this system is to\nbe similar to Amazon SQS or Sidekiq.\n\n\nReplication: Stand up a backup server that replicates some or\nall of your databases. If your primary server fails, start using the backup\nserver as the primary server. Or, replicate a production database into a local\nenvironment to test.\nReplication will catch issues when conflicts arise and provide methods to\nresolve those conflicts.\n\n\nClustering: Once your application has grown enough to worry\nabout high availability, clustering will allow you to share the load and\nreliability across a minimum of three servers. We plan to support being able\nto control clustering on a per-database level, and envision the ability to\ndeploy a globally distributed cluster with fine control over where your\ndatabases are placed.\n\n\nAnd more. We welcome feedback and suggestions.\n","id":"https://bonsaidb.io/about/","title":"What is BonsaiDb?"},"https://bonsaidb.io/benchmarks/":{"body":"\nWARNING: All of these benchmarks are currently wrong. Due to\nbreaking changes on main, we have not updated the graphs yet. This page will\nbe revised soon.\n\nBonsaiDb's goal for performance is to be comparable to other popular,\ngeneral-purpose, ACID-compliant databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and\nMongoDB. We do not consider performance to be a core focus in development and\nwill make decisions that create a better developer experience over raw\nperformance.\n\n\n\n\n    What do these benchmarks tell us about BonsaiDb?\n    \n\nBenchmarking a database is challenging, as each database has a unique set of\nfeatures. Microbenchmarks aren't good for evaluating performance, because often\nthe performance of various functionality changes based on what other load the\ndatabase is under. For example, read performance will be impacted by the amount\nof writes happening and vice-versa.\nThe Commerce Benchmark aims to provide a way to simulate\ndifferent ratios of read operations and write operations for a simple eCommerce\nschema. It might be tempting to use the results of this benchmark to claim that\nBonsaiDb will be faster for your application than another database choice.\nThe unfortunate reality is that no matter how well designed a benchmark suite\nis, it will never be able to predict the performance of a database solution for\nyour application with your usage patterns.\nThe only conclusion we want readers to draw from these benchmarks is:\nBonsaiDb's performance is comparable to other mainstream databases.\n\n\n\n\n    General Notes\n    \n\nAll benchmarks on this page are tailored to try to give a fair comparison\nbetween what functionality BonsaiDb offers and the closest equivalent mode in\nthe database being compared against. This means that there are ways to operate\nother databases in configurations that provide different guarantees (such as not\nbeing fully ACID-compliant) and sometimes those modes can yield faster\nexecution. These benchmarks will always pick the best way to compare other\ndatabases against BonsaiDb's guarantees, and as such, will not give a complete\npicture of any of the databases being compared.\nIt is important to consider the hardware which BonsaiDb will be deployed to.\nMany developers have more powerful development machines than their applications\neventually are deployed on.

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common data problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is BonsaiDb?.\n\nIt's been over six months since we announced PliantDb 0.1.0-dev.4. Beyond the name change, a lot has changed. We've been focusing our efforts on stabilizing BonsaiDb's core architecture so that we can start building applications with BonsaiDb. Today, we're excited to announce our first alpha release: version 0.1.0.\n\n\n\n\n    Upgrading existing databases\n    \n\nThere is no upgrade path from 0.1.0-dev.4. Prior to this release, we warned against using this project outside of experimentation, so we hope this is not an issue for anyone. However, if this is devastating news to anyone, please reach out to us, and we can try to help.\n\n\n\n\n    What does alpha mean?\n    \n\nThe biggest barrier to adoption was our own making: our README actively discouraged early-adopters except out of experimentation. We held off releasing this first alpha until after we were confident in the foundation we've laid. We expect bugs will be found, and we are certain that at least one user will lose data. It's just a fact of life. The alpha phase enables adventurous users to begin using BonsaiDb to help us find these issues before we label BonsaiDb \"stable.\"\nWe encourage users that attempt to use this in an environment where data loss would be detrimental to utilize and test the backup and restore functionality regularly.\nWe are still planning to add features during the alpha phase, but those features will focus on the higher-level database functionality. Changes to how data is stored will be minimal or non-existent unless bugs or performance issues are uncovered.\n\n\n\n\n    What's new?\n    \n\nWhile the fundamental ideas powering BonsaiDb are still the same as previous releases, this release left almost no code untouched. The GitHub stats show 29,933 additions and 11,678 across 450 commits -- and those stats don't include the new crates introduced. The release on GitHub covers all of the changes, but we wanted to draw attention to a few notable entries.\n\n\n\n\n    New Storage Layer\n    \n\nUnder the hood, this alpha unveils a new storage engine: Nebari. While the storage layer we were using before (Sled) is incredibly fast, it also is quite complex and didn't quite fit BonsaiDb's needs perfectly.\nNebari maintains a fairly straightforward design while still achieving fairly competitive benchmarks for being such a new library. Additionally, its implementation can be custom-tailored to the workloads we need to support BonsaiDb. Nebari performs quite well in our initial testing.\n\n\n\n\n    New Serialization Ecosystem\n    \n\nPart of our design from the beginning was to allow users to store arbitrary chunks of data as a document. In other words, users shouldn't be forced into a specific serialization or encoding format for their data. Unfortunately, a side effect of this was the API's usability suffered.\nThis alpha addresses the API shortcomings with functionality designed around Transmog. Transmog is a fairly simple concept: a universal set of traits to describe a basic serialization and deserialization interface. An example of Transmog in cation can be found in our new example: view-histogram.rs. It demonstrates storing a hdrhistogram::Histogram as a view's value by implementing the needed Transmog traits, allowing these types of fluid queries:\n// Retrieve an `hdrhistogram::Histogram` with all samples recorded.\nlet total_histogram = db.view::&lt;AsHistogram&gt;().reduce().await?;\nprintln!(\n    \"99th Percentile overall: {} ({} samples)\",\n    total_histogram.value_at_quantile(0.99),\n    total_histogram.len()\n);\n\nUsing Transmog as a foundation, BonsaiDb provides streamlined APIs for interacting with serialized collections.\n\n\n\n\n    Extensible TCP Handling\n    \n\nWe have a vision that BonsaiDb will be a complete application development platform, including building web applications. Therefore, we have created a way to theoretically use any HTTP framework and mount the BonsaiDb WebSockets at a specific route.\nWe have a new example (axum.rs) which demonstrates how to accomplish this using the Axum framework.\n\n\n\n\n    At-Rest Encryption\n    \n\nNot all hosting environments offer encrypted filesystems, and almost all applications store some Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, it is a good practice (and often a legal requirement) to ensure that all sensitive information is stored encrypted on the disk.\nBonsaiDb now optionally supports transparent at-rest encryption using externally stored keys.\n\n\n\n\n    Improving the Ecosystem\n    \n\nNew and updated crates in the Rust ecosystem power this release:\n\n\n\n\n    New Crates\n    \n\n\nderive-where: Derive standard traits more easily when generic type bounds are involved\nNebari: Low-level, transactional key-value storage\nordered-varint: Variable-length signed and unsigned integer encoding that retains sortable at the byte-level\nPot: A concise, self-describing binary serialization format.\nRustMe: Tool and library for managing READMEs for Rust projects\nTransmog: Universal serialization traits and utilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Updated Crates\n    \n\nThese are existing crates we've worked on as part of developing this release of BonsaiDb:\n\nasync-acme: Async ACME client for the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge type\npassword-hashes: Password hashing functions and KDFs.\nZeroize: Utilities for zeroing buffers before deallocating.\n\n\n\n\n\n    In-progress Crates\n    \n\nWe removed OPAQUE support for now, but will be reintroducing it in the\nfuture.\n@daxpedda has been hard at work helping bring the\necosystem up to the current draft spec:\n\ncustodian-password: High-level implementation of the OPAQUE password-authenticated key exchange protocol.\nopaque-ke: An implementation of the OPAQUE password-authenticated key exchange protocol. Used by custodian-password.\nvoprf: An implementation of a verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function.

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nThis month has been a journey of interesting projects that I have been itching\nto write about. The primary focus of the month was to work on a new project to\nuse and test BonsaiDb. Before I dive into that topic, I want to\nfocus on a bug fix for Nebari that arose from testing this new project.\n\n\n\n\n    Nebari 0.5.2 Update\n    \n\nYesterday, I published an update to Nebari which contains bug fixes\nthat prevent potential corruption of databases. For users of BonsaiDb, the view\nindexer is the only way that this bug could arise, from my understanding of the\nbugs discovered.\nThe problem with this bug is that it's a silent bug until a compact operation\noccurs. There are various debug_assert!() statements littered in the code that\nassert the internal B+ tree order is correct. These are expensive to\nperform, so they are only enabled in debug builds. Users who are running\nBonsaiDb or Nebari with release builds may not notice the bug, and the database\nmay return inconsistent results.\nThe only way I was able to reproduce the bug involved many multi-key\nModifications that operated in such a way that a bug in the\ntree balancing algorithm was found. The edge case only occurred when Nebari\nattempted to avoid splitting a node by moving entries both to the previous and\nnext nodes during the same operation. This is impossible on small trees and is\nimpossible to trigger by performing operations with only a few keys per\noperation or with a workflow that rarely deletes data.\nDespite me feeling fairly confident users haven't encountered this yet, I would\nrest better knowing users have run cargo update to the latest version.\n\n\n\n\n    Fuzzing Nebari\n    \n\nAfter I fixed the bug in Nebari, I proceeded to try to get a\nfuzzing suite set up. For those unfamiliar, fuzzing is an algorithmic\napproach to automated testing where a \"fuzzer\" repeatedly generates parameters\nfor a test in an attempt to discover bugs. The test I wrote\nessentialy was a dumb fuzzer -- the outer loop could be changed to loop forever.\nThe advantage of my hand-written test is that it was able to narrow down the\nfailure case quickly, as I knew some of the constraints of the inputs that\nproduced the bug I encountered. The disadvantage is that it only would find a\nspecific pattern of failure, as my inputs were not completely random.\nI ported the same approach to a fuzzer. The fuzzer is written to take an\narbitrary Vec&lt;BTreeSet&lt;u16&gt;&gt;&gt;. For each BTreeSet, a TreeFile is modified\nusing a CompareSwap that inserts the key if a value isn't already stored or\nremoves the key if a value is already stored. The fuzzer...\n\n1\nHey, who would have guessed it? Fuzzing works! As I was writing the last\nparagraph, the fuzzer found that my fix in v0.5.1 was incomplete. I\ncouldn't bring myself to continue writing the post and shifted to working on\na fix. I held off on releasing v0.5.2 until last\nnight, which allowed me to continue running fuzzing for 6 more hours after\nfixing the bug. It's been running continuously overnight and up to the point\nof publishing this post without further incident.\n\nThe fuzzer tries over and over to break my test by sending in different values\nfor the Vec&lt;BTreeSet&lt;u16&gt;&gt;. Once it discovers a failure, it saves the\nproblematic input so that it can be repeated on-demand.\nBut that's only part of what fuzzing can do for us. By running an \"input\nminimization\" operation on the crashing input, the fuzzer will try to find the\nsmallest input that can reproduce the failure. It saves each of the discovered\nfailure cases so they can be tested independently if desired. Once it can no\nlonger find a smaller input, it reports the minimized test case.\nI was feeling pretty confident in Nebari's stability before Friday. My\nconfidence has been shaken, but as I write more fuzzing tests and run them for\nextended periods of time, I'm hopeful I can weed out any remaining bugs and\nrestore my confidence.\n\n\n\n\n    Dogfooding: Shrinking Git Repository Sizes\n    \n\nAt the start of the month, I really wanted to build something with BonsaiDb. One\nproblem BonsaiDb contributors have is related to my choice to use GitHub\nPages to build a deployed version of BonsaiDb's\ndocumentation, benchmark\nresults, and user's guide on every\ncommit. The way this works is that a workflow\ngenerates the static websites into a gh-pages branch, and GitHub deploys the\nlatest version of that branch automatically.\nThis comes at a cost, however. If you have cloned BonsaiDb's repository, you\nprobably noticed that the repository is quite large. Using Git, we can inspect\nhow much disk space the main branch takes up compared to the gh-pages\nbranch:\n# Total size of commits reachable from `main`\ngit rev-list --disk-usage --objects  refs/heads/main\n&gt;     4,302,211 (~4.3mb)\n# Total size of commits not reachable from `main`.\ngit rev-list --disk-usage --objects --all --not refs/heads/main\n&gt; 3,215,042,793 (~3.2gb)\n\nBy moving gh-pages hosting somewhere else, I can reduce BonsaiDb's repository\nsize down to a few megabytes instead of a few gigabytes. I'm aware there are\nother approaches that can be taken to alleviate this problem, but when paired\nwith a request to add support for file storage, I saw it as an\nopportunity to dogfood BonsaiDb.\nOn Friday, I deployed Dossier to khonsu.dev. I loaded\nall of the BonsaiDb gh-pages files, but then encountered a slower sync time\nthan I had hoped for. I had an idea for an optimization for\nlisting files in bonsaidb-files and proceeded to update the View used for that\noperation and incremented its version number. This informs BonsaiDb it should\ndiscard all of the previously indexed data and reindex that view. While testing\nthis locally against a database that had been used extensively for days and had\nover 100,000 files in it, I encountered the Nebari bug covered above. This\ncaused me to pause progress on Dossier, as I will always prioritize any bugs\nrelating to data integrity.\nI was hoping this blog post would announce that all of BonsaiDb's static pages,\nincluding this blog, were hosted using Dossier, but I haven't quite reached that\nmilestone. I'm hopeful that will be true within the next week, however!\n\n\n\n\n    Easier Administration of BonsaiDb\n    \n\nAnother challenge I faced in building Dossier is that I needed a way to\nadminister permissions. One morning I had the thought: \"It'd be great if I had a\ntool like psql.\" For those unfamiliar, psql is a simple command line\ninterface that allows you to execute commands on a PostgreSQL database. Of\ncourse, most databases have SQL, and BonsaiDb has no language.\nPreviously, I had considered the extensible command line\ninterface to be a good approach, but as I added authentication\nsupport, I realized that every operation was going to re-authenticate. One\nadvantage a tool like pqsl has is that it authenticates once upon launch and\nthen reuses the same connection for subsequent commands.\nBecause developing programming languages is a hobby of mine, one day I whipped\nup a demo exploring the idea of a language that worked both as a proc macro and\nas a string:\nlet results = bql!( let my_new_user = user \"ecton\" create with password \"hunter2\" )\n    .execute_on(&amp;storage)\n    .unwrap();\nprintln!(\"Created user id: {:?}\", results.get(\"my_new_user\").unwrap());\n\nlet results = Program::parse(r#\"let jon = user \"jon\" create;\"#)\n    .unwrap()\n    .execute_on(&amp;storage)\n    .unwrap();\nprintln!(\"Created user id: {:?}\", results.get(\"jon\").unwrap());\n\nI was envisioning allowing this language to be extended. For example, the\nbonsaidb-files crate should be able to define its own commands. This creates\nan interesting problem that I decided wasn't worth tackling: proc-macros cannot\ninvoke code in types that are outside of its own list of dependencies.\nIn the end, I decided that the use case for a language for use within Rust would\nbe unlikely to surpass a well designed API's fluidity. I put aside this\nexperiment for now, and for Dossier, I've continued to\nexpand BonsaiDb's built-in command line interface.\n\n\n\n\n    Open File Limits\n    \n\nEarlier in the month, I was testing something on my Mac laptop, and I decided to\ninvoke the entire test suite with all features enabled on that machine. I ran\ninto an error due to having too many open files. I expected\nto eventually run into this, and I was proud that my test suite was the first I\nheard of it from a user. One might ask, why does the test suite using so many\nfiles that it's a problem on that machine?\nMost of the unit tests in BonsaiDb are written against the core traits like\nConnection and StorageConnection. The\ncore-suite integration test uses bonsaidb-client to run the test suite\nagainst a shared bonsaidb-server instance. Each unit test for each connection\ntype gets its own database. The schema most tests utilize has multiple views,\neach which uses a few files to track their state.\nBut still, with roughly 100 unit tests in the suite and two connection types, that\nis only a few hundred files. It turns out that Mac OS has a default per-process\nlimit of 256 open files.\nIn production, this is easily worked around by configuring the server's\nenvironment, so this issue wasn't a huge priority to me. But my mind started\nexploring what sort of data structure I might need to solve this problem. I\nwanted to use an LRU thought an LRU cache that worked with a BTreeMap instead of a HashMap. Alas,\nnone of the existing crates seemed to offer this functionality. I whipped up my\nown LRU crate (awaiting publication).\nDespite being 100% safe, it is very similar in performance compared to the\nunsafe crate Nebari currently uses.\nI attempted a few approaches in Nebari, but it's a tough problem to solve. As\nthis work was dragging on, I really wanted to stop chasing this squirrel and\nmake progress on my original goal of the month. I will be finishing up this\nproblem in the next month or two. Until then, if you run into this issue, you\ncan configure your system to increase the maximum open files for your process,\nuser, or system.\n\n\n\n\n    RFC: Token Authentication\n    \n\nI've written up a request for comments discussion about\nhow I've implemented token authentication for BonsaiDb. I'm dogfooding token\nauthentication within Dossier by using it to power API Tokens that each GitHub\nRepository can have to upload files. The Dossier server uses BonsaiDb's built-in\nRole-Based Access Control to verify permissions when\nsynchronizing files.\nSince I've created a new approach and am using a newer algorithm\n(BLAKE3), I wanted to see if there was any inherent problems with the\napproach I'm taking. Unless I hear from someone who is a cryptographer, I'm\nlikely to document this feature as \"experimental\" for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n    What's next?\n    \n\nI'm going to be continuing to expand the fuzzing suite for Nebari to try to\nensure it's rock-solid. After that, I want to finish moving most of Khonsu Labs'\nself-hosted static pages onto Dossier. Once that is all done, I expect I will\nfeel ready to release the next update to BonsaiDb.\n\n\n\n\n    Getting Started\n    \n\nOur homepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples.

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nI'm excited to announce v0.2.0, which brings two major features in\naddition to many small improvements and fixes. There are API-level changes that\nare potentially breaking changes. The CHANGELOG should help navigate through the changes\nnecessary to update your projects.\n\n\n\n\n    Custom Primary Keys\n    \n\nOne design decision that was made early in BonsaiDb's development was to use a\nu64 as the unique id/primary key for all documents. This was largely done to\nsimplify the API, and I felt like it was reasonable that users could create an\nalternate key using a unique view.\nI've attempted twice before to change it to allow customizing the primary key,\nbut each time I ended up reverting the changes as I didn't like the impact to\nthe API. However, this time I've succeeded in adding this API with minimal\nimpact to the high-level API.\nOur new example demonstrates how this feature can be\nused with the Collection derive macro:\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Collection, Eq, PartialEq)]\n#[collection(name = \"multi-key\", primary_key = (u32, u64))]\nstruct MultiKey {\n    value: String,\n}\n\nasync fn test&lt;C: Connection&gt;(db: C) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let inserted = MultiKey {\n        value: String::from(\"hello\"),\n    }\n    .insert_into((42, 64), &amp;db)\n    .await?;\n    let retrieved = MultiKey::get((42, 64), &amp;db)\n        .await?\n        .expect(\"document not found\");\n}\n\nThe way this is implemented, any type that implements Key trait and\nisn't too large can be used as a primary key. The current size limitation is\npurely for optimization, and may be relaxed in the future.\nMore information about this feature can be found in our user guide.\n\n\n\n\n    LZ4 Compression\n    \n\nA potential user was originally trying to diagnose why BonsaiDb was creating\nlarger databases than Sled. After some troubleshooting, it was discovered that\nthey had enabled the zstd feature in Sled, enabling automatic compression of\ndata being stored.\nThis was a feature I had already planned on supporting, although my research had\nled me to believe that LZ4 was a better choice for an algorithm. Without doing\ncomparative benchmarking personally, I decided to start with LZ4 compression and\nadd zstd once namespaced features are released in Rust.\nSome benchmarks have been updated to include compression for comparision. The\nresults are interesting to look at, but no serious comparisons should be drawn\nyet. If you are under tight space constraints, this feature can save a lot of\nstorage space while not impacting performance in a major way.\n\nAs you can see in this graph, the Commerce\nBenchmark sometimes shows\nimproved performance over the uncompressed version. As always, performance will\ndepend on your hardware and operating environment, which is why this is an\nopt-in feature.\nThe user who originally asked about this feature had reported that BonsaiDb's\nuncompressed database size a staggering 30x larger than the equivalent data in\nSled. The next day they were able to test a branch with the feature enabled.

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nBonsaiDb v0.3.0 has been released featuring optimized view\nprocessing, bug fixes, and a few new features -- including one from a new\ncontributor!\nOptimization of the view processing system has been covered in the previous\nblog post.\n\n\n\n\n    Deleting users via StorageConnection\n    \n\nA new function, delete_user() has been added to StorageConnection, allowing\nfor users to not only be created but also deleted without direct database\naccess. This feature was added by @vbmade2000 -- now the third\ncontributor to the BonsaiDb repository!\nBonsaiDb provides open-access its admin schema types. This meant\nthat users could still be deleted, but it required doing so directly through\nStorage::admin(), and couldn't be done over a networked client, for example.\n\n\n\n\n    Querying Data by Prefix\n    \n\nA user on Discord requested an easier way to be able to query data using a\nprefix. For example, if the key type is a String or Vec&lt;u8&gt;, a query should\nbe able to be made for any matches that start with a given prefix. Collections\nnow support listing documents with a given prefix:\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Collection)]\n#[collection(name = \"MyCollection\", primary_key = String)]\npub struct MyCollection;\n\nlet results = MyCollection::list_with_prefix(String::from(\"a\"), db).await?;\n\nresults will contain all documents whose id's start with a. The same\ncapability is also available for views:\n#[derive(View, Debug, Clone)]\n#[view(name = \"by-name\", key = String, collection = MyCollection)]\nstruct ByName;\n\nfor mapping in db\n    .view::&lt;ByName&gt;()\n    .with_key_prefix(String::from(\"a\"))\n    .query()\n    .await?\n{\n    assert!(mapping.key.starts_with(\"a\"));\n    println!(\"{} in document {:?}\", mapping.key, mapping.source);\n}\n\nThis functionality is powered by a new trait,\nIntoPrefixRange,\nwhich allows any custom key type to provide this functionality if possible.\nBonsaiDb currently only provides implementations for String and the Vec&lt;u8&gt;\ntypes.\n\n\n\n\n    Nebari Bug Fixes\n    \n\nThis release updates Nebari to v0.4.0. It contains\nan important fix to ensure the transaction log is always written sequentially.\nThis edge case was discovered while running unit tests \"one more time\" before\npreparing a release. A unit test that never failed suddenly failed. Here's the\ncode in question that failed:\nlet mut handles = Vec::new();\nfor _ in 0..10 {\n    let manager = manager.clone();\n    handles.push(std::thread::spawn(move || {\n        for id in 0_u32..1_000 {\n            let tx = manager.new_transaction([&amp;id.to_be_bytes()[..]]);\n            tx.commit().unwrap();\n        }\n    }));\n}\n\nThe test then proceeds to wait for all the threads to finish and verify the\nresults. One thing it does is attempt to load each transaction one by one. At\nfirst glance, this seems innocuous, but due to how Nebari is designed,\nnew_transaction() allocates a transaction id, but it isn't written to the\ntransaction log until commit() occurs. I was lucky to have this test fail,\nas it was a legitimate edge case that I hadn't tested against. Needless to say,\nthere's now a dedicated unit test to out-of-order writing.\nWhile working on this fix, however, I now have enough of a reason to implement\nthe next version of the transaction log to address a few design issues I've\nthought of since writing it originally. The good news is that even if the\ntransaction log your database has currently is out of order, I plan to have the\nupgrade process to the new format fix any ordering issues.\n\n\n\n\n    Getting Started\n    \n\nOur homepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples.

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nBonsaiDb v0.4.0 has been released with a new blocking (non-async)\nAPI, better identity/authentication session management, and many other\nimprovements. The full list of changes can be viewed on the GitHub Release\npage.\nFor readers who enjoy the \"This month in BonsaiDb\" updates, this release\nannouncement takes the place of that post this month.\n\n\n\n\n    Updating existing projects\n    \n\nThis update contains no changes to how data is stored. However, there are a\nlarge number of types that have been renamed to distinguish async types from\nblocking types.\nIf you have an existing project and want to continue using async, here are the\ntypes that you need to find and replace with their async counterparts in your\nproject:\nCrateBlocking TypeAsync Type\nCoreConnectionAsyncConnection\nCoreStorageConnectionAsyncStorageConnection\nCorePubSubAsyncPubSub\nCoreSubscriberAsyncSubscriber\nCoreKeyValueAsyncKeyValue\nCoreLowLevelConnectionAsyncLowLevelConnection\nLocalStorageAsyncStorage\nLocalDatabaseAsyncDatabase\n\nAfter changing these types, you might encounter errors with functions like\nSerializedCollection::push_into or SerializedCollection::list. In every\nsituation that this happens, you should be able to simply add _async to the\nfunction name. For example, SerializedCollection::push_into_async is the async\nversion of SerializedCollection::push_into.\nIf you are using the local version of BonsaiDb, Tokio has become an optional\ndependency. To enable async, enable the appropriate feature for whichever crate\nyou're importing:\nbonsaidb = { version = \"0.4.0\", features = [\"local\", \"local-async\"] }\nbonsaidb-local = { version = \"0.4.0\", default-features = false, features = [\"async\"] }\n\nThere are other small breaking changes which are unlikely to affect most users.\nThe full list can be viewed in the CHANGELOG or release\npage.\nFor those it might help, I've updated an example project of\nmine from v0.2 to this new release. The changes can be viewed in this\ncommit. This project features a client/server workspace\nand uses BonsaiDb's custom API functionality.\n\n\n\n\n    Why introduce a blocking API?\n    \n\nBonsaiDb has always wrapped Nebari's blocking API with\ntokio::task::spawn_blocking and exposed an async API. The\nreason behind this initial design was that the local-only version of BonsaiDb\nwas a convenience feature, and the \"real\" benefit of projects adopting BonsaiDb\nwas to use its server mode (and eventually clustering mode). I believe strongly\nthat async is the best way to design a server that has long-lasting connections,\nand the types of applications I envision being developed with BonsaiDb fit that\naccess model: Remote PubSub, Server-Push Apis, and more.\nOne day I was joking that a friend wouldn't want to use BonsaiDb for his project\nbecause it would force him to use async. While he proceeded to say that async\nwouldn't stop him, the exchange made me take stock of the current users of\nBonsaiDb. Of all the people who I know are using BonsaiDb, most were only using\nthe local version and many weren't building networked applications.\nCase in point, one user was painstakingly porting their\nproject to async from sync to be able to use BonsaiDb. Thankfully, this set of\nchanges were already underway, and they were able to be the first external\ntester of the new blocking API.\n\n\n\n\n    How does BonsaiDb enable both blocking and async access?\n    \n\nFor the the local implementation, the most direct implementation is the blocking\nimplementation. This means that there will be less overhead on local\n\"connections\" using the non-async interface. The overhead of the async types is\nvery low, but it is\npresent, and it is the same overhead that has always been present on BonsaiDb's\ninterface.\nThe local implementation exposes Storage and\nDatabase, which implement\nStorageConnection and Connection\nrespectively. These types are the blocking types.\nAsyncStorage and AsyncDatabase implement\nAsyncStorageConnection and\nAsyncConnection. These types are the async types that\ninternally store a handle to the Tokio runtime they belong to. This grants these\ntypes the ability to spawn blocking tasks as needed, even when used in\nasync code that is using another async runtime.\nAll local types offer several convenient functions that allow seamless\nconversion to and from each other, enabling applications that use both blocking\nand async to use BonsaiDb as their database with ease.\nThe server implementation currently only exposes an initialization API that is\ncompatible with async code. Once the server is initialized, however, a\nServer/CustomServer instance can be converted to\nStorage, enabling blocking access to the underlying storage layer.\nThe Client type used for accessing a server implements both\nStorageConnection and AsyncStorageConnection, except for on WASM where no\nblocking implementation is provided. Currently, all networking implementations\nrequire Tokio to drive their networking behind the scenes, but in the future\nalternative implementations are possible to remove the reliance on Tokio for the\nnetwork client.\n\n\n\n\n    Improved authenticated session handling\n    \n\nPrior to this release, there was no way to enforce database permissions in the\noffline version of BonsaiDb. If you are building a multi-user app but are using\nyour own web server, how are you supposed to be able to leverage BonsaiDb's\npermissions and authentication?\nThis release addresses this problem by moving all permission checking into the\noffline version and adding assume_identity() to\nStorageConnection/AsyncStorageConnection. Assuming an identity requires the\npermission to be allowed by the current connection. These changes allow all\napplications that need multi-user support to use the built-in role-based access\ncontrol and, optionally, the built-in password authentication.\nEach connection object now has an associated Session, available\nthrough the new HasSession trait. The functions\nassume_identity() and authenticate() return a new instance that is\nauthenticated with the updated identity and associated permissions. The original\nconnection retains its original authentication. This allows multiple\nauthentication sessions to coexist on the same underlying connection, regardless\nof if it's a local or remote connection.\nWhen opening a local storage/database/server, the connection begins with no\nidentity and restricted permissions. When connecting to a remote server, the\nclient's unauthenticated session is limited to the permissions from\nServerConfiguration::default_permissions. After\nauthenticating a user or assuming an identity,\nStorageConfiguration::authenticated_permissions\nwill be merged with the identity's granted permissions.\nI hope to see users trying out BonsaiDb's built-in user management and\nrole-based access control!\n\n\n\n\n    Primary Key/View Key improvements\n    \n\nThe Key trait has been split into two traits: Key\nand KeyEncoding. This split has enabled various queries to\ntake borrowed representations of the keys. For example, a String key type can\nnow be queried using an &amp;str:\nlet doc = MyCollection::get(\"my key\", &amp;db)?;\nlet mappings = db.view::&lt;MyView&gt;().with_key(\"my key\").query()?;\n\nAdditional types now have Key implementations provided for them: [u8; N],\nSystemTime and Duration.\n\n\n\n\n    Using Time as a Key\n    \n\nBoth SystemTime and Duration are stored with the full range that Duration\nsupports. In memory, these types require 12 bytes to represent, and even with\nvariable integer encoding, the values encoded as keys can still be fairly long.\nMost users don't need nanosecond precision with the range of 42 times the age of\nthe universe. After a fun coworking session on our Discord server, I\nintroduced LimitedResolutionDuration and\nLimitedResolutionTimestamp. These types allow representing durations and\ntimestamps using smaller in-memory representations, and offer additional\ncompression using variable integer encoding and customizable epochs.\nTo see an example of the benefits, compare timestamps encoded over the span of\nthe next 40 years and their Key-encoded lengths:\n\nAs you can see, SystemTime encodes as 9 bytes (and will continue to do so\nuntil year 10,680). SystemTime's Key implementation encodes the duration\nfrom the unix epoch, so this means that Durations that of 52 years with\nnanosecond precision take 9 bytes to encode. The smaller the Duration being\nencoded, the smaller the output will be.\nBy using one millisecond resolution, we can reduce the number of bytes down to 6\nand also use only 8 bytes in memory to represent the value. By using one second\nresolution, we can further reduce the key size by another byte.\nHow can we compress timestamps further? By leveraging an Epoch that is closer to\nthe median of the expected timestamp/duration range, we can allow the variable\ninteger encoding to shine. The closer to the Epoch the timestamp is, the smaller\nthe value is.\nIn the above chart, the two values that dip in the middle use\nBonsaiEpoch. After considering that databases either live long\nenough to be used for almost an eternity (PostgreSQL was first released in the\n1980s) or live a short life. I thought the 10-year anniversary of the first\ncommit of BonsaiDb seemed like a good idea.\nDespite it being an arbitrary decision, further consideration showed that epoch\nis good for one reason: Nanosecond-resolution timestamps encoded today will\nencode as 8 bytes, and will continue doing so until year 2,049. If an epoch\nslightly farther out were chosen, today's timestamps would encode with a full 9\nbytes, offering no benefit over the unix epoch version. This extra byte of\nsavings isn't much, but it does make the key size word size or less on most\nmodern machines.\nI've added a full set of types that support resolutions ranging\nfrom nanoseconds to weeks, and timestamp types that support both the BonsaiDb\nand unix epochs. You can also implement your own resolution\nand/or epoch to tailor fit how these new types work.\n\n\n\n\n    Other contributors this release\n    \n\nI wanted to make sure to include a mention for @vbmade2000's\ncontributions to this release. They added the ability to delete users,\nand the ability to retrieve a list of document headers without fetching\nthe document's contents.\nIf you are interested in contributing to BonsaiDb, I am trying to keep a healthy\nlist of good first issues.\n\n\n\n\n    Getting Started\n    \n\nOur homepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples.

Although we are keeping the alpha label, we are hoping to find some\nadventurous users who are excited at our vision of a database designed for and\nwritten in Rust.\nOne obvious question that almost everyone will ask at some point when hearing\nabout a new database: how does it perform?\nBonsaiDb is a unique database. It is best described as a NoSQL\ndatabase, but traditionally NoSQL databases tend to favor eventual consistency\nand speed over ACID compliance. When starting this project, I specifically\nwanted to have all the guarantees PostgreSQL makes, but easier to use and deploy.\nUntil this past week, I knew from previous benchmarks that Nebari (our\nunderlying storage layer) was pretty fast, but I had no real\nindicator of how BonsaiDb would perform relative to PostgreSQL.\n\n\n\n\n    Designing a Benchmark Suite\n    \n\nI had three different parameters I wanted to measure:\n\nDataset size\nThe amount of concurrent workers\nRead-heavy vs Write-heavy workloads\n\nI decided to create a benchmark suite inspired by the needs of an ecommerce\nwebsite. The basic idea is to generate an initial data set, a list of plans for\nworkers to execute, and test the dataset and plans using different quantities of\nworkers. The operations being benchmarked are:\n\nLookup product by id\nFind product by name (exact match)\nCreate shopping cart\nAdd product to cart\nCheckout\nReview a product\n\nA single plan is generated by using probabilities to adjust how many plans\nsucceed in each step of the shopping process. Some plans will search for\nproducts and never add them to a cart; Others will not only purchase the\nproduct, but also write a review. By adjusting the probabilities of each action\noccurring, we create a funnel that allows us to adjust the ratio of reads and\nwrites.\nI've written some more notes on the implementation of the benchmark itself, such\nas how aggregation of ratings is handled, in the benchmark's\nREADME.\n\n\n\n\n    BonsaiDb is faster than I had hoped!\n    \n\nEdit 2022-05-25: These benchmarks were discovered to have serious problems.\nRead more here.\nThese graphs show the accumulated execution time of each operation:\n\n\n\nThis set of graphs is from the \"large, write-heavy, 2 workers per core\"\nbenchmark, run on a Scaleway GP1-XS instance running\nUbuntu 20.04 with 4 CPU cores, 16GB of RAM, and local NVME storage. The entire\nsuite's results can be viewed here as well.\nAs I started seeing these results, I was simply blown away. I've tried to be as\nfair as possible in writing this benchmark suite. Over time I\nplan on adding additional database backends for comparison, as well as\nadditional operations as BonsaiDb gains more features.\nOne major difference between PostgreSQL and BonsaiDb is the lack of SQL. With\nBonsaiDb, the query language is Rust itself. This is why I often refer to\nBonsaiDb as a programmable database. The interface for accessing your data is\nhow you design it. For example, here's the implementation of find product:\nlet product = Product::load(&amp;operation.name, &amp;self.database)\n    .await\n    .unwrap() // Result\n    .unwrap(); // Option&lt;CollectionDocument&lt;Product&gt;&gt;\nlet rating = self\n    .database\n    .view::&lt;ProductReviewsByProduct&gt;()\n    .with_key(product.id as u32)\n    .with_access_policy(AccessPolicy::NoUpdate)\n    .reduce()\n    .await\n    .unwrap(); // Returns a f32\n\n\n\n\n\n    Trying out BonsaiDb\n    \n\nBonsaiDb is currently labeled experimental. We are working to stabilize\ncustodian-password, which has involved updating many existing\ncrates to improve the OPAQUE-KE\necosystem in Rust. After that is done, we are going to label BonsaiDb as alpha.\nIt hasn't been used by many people yet, so we expect that there will be bugs and\nsome of those bugs might even cause loss of data. That being said, we've been\nusing it ourselves with KhonsuLabs.com since early\nNovember 2021 with no issues, in addition to a couple other small test projects.\nWe encourage most users to wait another week or two until we have the alpha on\nCrates.io, but for those looking to play with something new, we'd love any\nfeedback from early users. We've already made countless improvements to the API,\ndocumentation, user's guide and\nexamples as a result of questions from early adopters.\nIf you're interested in BonsaiDb but want to wait until we've released a stable\nversion, we invite you to subscribe to this site's feed or\nwatch the repository's releases section.\nWe are looking forward to seeing what types of applications BonsaiDb will power someday!\n\nHave questions or comments?

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\n\n\n\n\n    tl;dr: BonsaiDb is slower than previously reported\n    \n\nThe day after the last post, @justinj\nreported that they traced one of the Nebari examples and did not see any fsync\nsyscalls being executed. This was an honest mistake of misunderstanding the term\n\"true sink\" in std::io::Write. It turns out Write::flush()'s\nimplementation for std::io::File is a no-op, as the \"true sink\" is the kernel,\nnot the disk.\nI released Nebari v0.5.3 the same day. I ran the Nebari\nbenchmark suite and... nothing changed. I ran the suite on GitHub Actions, no\nchange. I ran the suite on my dedicated VPS I use for a more stable benchmarking\nenvironment than GitHub Actions... no change. I ran the suite on my Mac... huge\nslowdown. I'll cover why further in this post, but my initial impression was\nthat I dodged a bullet somehow.\nA few days later, I noticed the BonsaiDb Commerce Benchmark was running slowly.\nI quickly realized it was due to the synchronization changes and began an\nentire rewrite of the view indexer and document storage. A\nfew days ago, I reached a stage where I could run the suite with my changes.\nExcited to see if it was enough to catch back up to PostgreSQL, I ran it and...\nit was a little faster but was still very slow.\nThe rest of this post explores everything I've learned since then. Since this a\nsummary, let me end with a tl;dr: Reading data from BonsaiDb is still very\nefficient, but due to mistakes in benchmarking, writes are quite slow for\nworkflows that insert or update a lot of data in a single collection. I am still\nexcited and motivated to build BonsaiDb, but I am currently uncertain whether I\nwill still write my own low-level database layer. All assumptions about\nBonsaiDb's performance must be reset.\n\n\n\n\n    Why didn't my refactor help?\n    \n\nThe rest of that day and the next two days were spent profiling and trying to\nunderstand the results. I would then try to test my assumptions in an isolated\ntest, and I wasn't able to make significant progress.\nThe following day as I was sipping coffee, I ran df to check my disk's free\nspace. I realized that each time I ran that command, /tmp was always listed as\na separate mountpoint. I use Manjaro Linux (based on Arch), and while I can\ngenerally solve any problems I have with my computer, I never considered the\nimplications of /tmp listed.\nGiven that it's a separate mountpoint than my main filesystem, the next logical\nquestion is: what filesystem does it use? The answer: tmpfs, a\nfilesystem that acts like a RAM-disk and never persists your files except\nthrough memory paging. fsync is essentially a no-op on such a filesystem. Many\nof my benchmarks and tests used the excellent tempfile crate.\nDespite having worked with Linux off and on since the early 2000s, I never\nnoticed this detail. The temporary directory is not a different filesystem on\nthe Mac, which is one factor in why Nebari's benchmarks exhibited a major change\non the Mac while no change on Linux.\n\n\n\n\n    Should I continue Nebari?\n    \n\nThe realization that all of my testing of other database's performance was\nseverely flawed meant that I needed to recheck everything. There is a real\nquestion: should I just ditch Nebari and use another database to back BonsaiDb?\nThinking about my motivations, I've never wanted to create \"the fastest\ndatabase.\"\nMy pitch for BonsaiDb has always been about developer experience and being \"good\nenough\" for \"most people.\" I believe there are a lot of developers who waste a\nlot of development cycles building apps that are more concerned about\nhigh-availability than being able to scale to be the next Google. At that scale,\na one-size-fits-all solution is almost never the solution. If I can simplify\nscaling from a test project to a highly-available solution and do it with\n\"reasonable\" performance, I've met my goals for BonsaiDb.\nThe benefits of Nebari come down to it being tailor-fit to BonsaiDb's needs.\nWith my new approach to document and view storage that leverages Nebari's\nability to embed custom stats within its B+Tree, it meant I could build and\nquery map-reduce views in a very efficient manner. I have yet to see another\nlow-level database written in Rust that enables embedding custom information\ninside of the B+Tree structure to enable these capabilities.\nBecause a tailor-fit solution is so attractive, I wanted to explore what it\nmight take to make Nebari faster.\n\n\n\n\n    Why is Nebari slow?\n    \n\nTo answer that question, I needed to fix my usage of tempfile in the Nebari\nbenchmark. After doing that, Nebari still competed with\nSQLite on many benchmarks, but Sled\nwas reporting astonishing numbers. This led me to question whether Sled's\ntransactions are actually ACID-compliant when explicitly asking for them to be\nflushed.\nSee, in my testing, I was able to determine that fdatasync() was unable to\nreturn in less than 1 millisecond on my machine. Here's the output if the\ntransactional insert benchmark measuring the time it takes to do an\nACID-complaint insert of 1KB of data to a new key:\nblobs-insert/nebari-versioned/1KiB\n                        time:   [2.6591 ms 2.6920 ms 2.7348 ms]\n                        thrpt:  [365.66 KiB/s 371.47 KiB/s 376.07 KiB/s]\nblobs-insert/nebari/1KiB\n                        time:   [2.6415 ms 2.6671 ms 2.7023 ms]\n                        thrpt:  [370.05 KiB/s 374.93 KiB/s 378.57 KiB/s]\nblobs-insert/sled/1KiB  time:   [38.438 us 38.894 us 39.376 us]                                    \n                        thrpt:  [24.801 MiB/s 25.108 MiB/s 25.406 MiB/s]\nblobs-insert/sqlite/1KiB\n                        time:   [4.0630 ms 4.1192 ms 4.1913 ms]\n                        thrpt:  [238.59 KiB/s 242.76 KiB/s 246.12 KiB/s]\n\nAs you can see, Nebari sits in the middle with 2.6ms, SQLite is the slowest with\n4.11ms, and Sled reports an incredibly short 38.9Î¼s. After a quick skim of\nSled's source, Sled isn't calling fdatasync() most of the time when you ask it\nto flush its buffers. It's using a different API: sync_file_range().\nFrom the output above, you might be tempted to infer that Sled never calls\nfsdatasync, since the max single iteration time for Sled is 39.4Î¼s, and I\nclaim that fdatasync never completes in under 1ms on my machine. However,\nCriterion uses sampling-based statistics, which means that it doesn't look at\nindividual iteration times but rather iteration times for a set number of\niterations.\nBy logging out each individual iteration time, I can see that there are\nindividual iterations that do take as long as an fdatasync call. To\nsimplify, I created three tests to benchmark:\n\nappend: Write to the end of the file and call fdatasync.\npreappend: When a write needs more space in the file, extend the file using\nftruncate before writing. Call fdatasync after each write.\nsyncrange: When a write needs more space, extend the file using ftruncate\nand calling fdatasync after the write. When a write does not need more\nspace, call sync_file_range to persist the newly written data.\n\nThe output of this benchmark is:\nwrites/append           time:   [2.6211 ms 2.6585 ms 2.7058 ms]\nwrites/preallocate      time:   [1.2467 ms 1.2675 ms 1.2923 ms]\nwrites/syncrange        time:   [190.59 us 193.03 us 195.83 us]\n\nOur syncrange benchmark appears to not ever take longer than 195.8Î¼s. But, we\nknow that it calls fdatasync, so what's happening? Let's open up Criterion's raw.csv report for syncrange:\ngroupfunctionvaluethroughput_numthroughput_typesample_measured_valueunititeration_count\nwritessyncrange2,929,333.0ns6\nwritessyncrange2,932,484.0ns12\nwritessyncrange5,701,286.0ns18\nwritessyncrange5,788,786.0ns24\n\nCriterion isn't keeping track of every iteration. It keeps track of batches.\nBecause of this, the final statistics tallied aren't able to see the true\nmaximum iteration time. Let's run the same benchmark in my own benchmarking\nharness:\nLabelavgminmaxstddevout%\nappend2.628ms2.095ms5.702ms147.0us0.004%\npreallocate1.243ms612.3us4.042ms859.3us0.004%\nsyncrange189.1us12.83us2.847ms653.6us0.063%\n\nUsing this harness, I can now see results that make sense. The averages\nmatch what we see from Criterion, but now our min and max show a wider range. We\ncan now see that even for the syncrange benchmark, some writes will take\n2.8ms.\nThe takeaway is very important: using sync_file_range, Sled is able to make\nthe average write's time take 38.9Î¼s, even though occasionally there will be\nwrite operations that are longer due to the need for an fdatasync\nwhen the file's size changes.\nGiven how much faster sync_file_range() is, is it safe to use to achieve\ndurable writes?\n\n\n\n\n    What does sync_file_range do?\n    \n\nsync_file_range() has many modes of operation. At its core, it offers the\nability to ask the kernel to commit any dirty cached data to the filesystem. For\nthe purposes of this post, we are most interested in the mode of operation when\nSYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE,  SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE, and\nSYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER are passed.\nWith these flags, sync_file_range() is documented to wait for all dirty pages\nwithin the range provided to be flushed to disk. However, the documentation for\nthis function advises that it is \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n    What are 'durable writes'?\n    \n\nWhen writing data to a file, the operating system does not immediately write the\nbits to the phsysical disk. This would be incredibly slow, even with modern\nSSDs. Instead, operating systems will typically manage a cache of the underlying\nstorage and occasionally flush the updated information to the storage. This\nallows writes to be fast and enables the operating system to attempt to schedule\nand reorder operations for efficiency.\nThe problem with this approach occurs when the power suddenly is cut to the\nmachine. Imagine a user hits \"Save\" in their program, the program confirmed it\nwas saved, and suddenly the building's power dies. The program claimed it saved\nthe file, but upon rebooting, the file is missing or corrupt. How does that\nhappen? The file may have only been saved to the kernel's cache and never\nwritten to the physical disk.\nThe solution is called flushing or syncing. Each operating system exposes one or\nmore functions to ensure all writes to a file have successfully been persisted\nto the physical media:\n\nOn Linux, it's fsync(), fdatasync(), and\nsync_file_range().\nOn Windows, it's FlushFileBuffers.\nOn Mac/iOS, fsync() is available but does not provide the same guarantees as\nLinux. Instead, a call to fcntl with the F_FULLFSYNC option must be used\nto trigger a write to physical media.\n\nRust uses the correct APIs for each platform when calling File::sync_all or\nFile::sync_data to provide durable writes. The standard library does not\nprovide APIs to invoke the underlying APIs mentioned above. Thankfully, the\nlibc crate makes it easy to call the APIs we are interested in for this post.\n\n\n\n\n    Linux: Is sync_file_range viable for durable writes?\n    \n\nThe man page for sync_file_range() includes this warning\n(emphasis mine):\n\nThis system call is extremely dangerous and should not be used in portable\nprograms. None of these operations writes out the file's metadata.\nTherefore, unless the application is strictly performing overwrites of\nalready-instantiated disk blocks, there are no guarantees that the data will\nbe available after a crash. There is no user interface to know if a write is\npurely an overwrite. On filesystems using copy-on-write semantics (e.g.,\nbtrfs) an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible. When\nwriting into preallocated space, many filesystems also require calls into the\nblock allocator, which this system call does not sync out to disk. This\nsystem call does not flush disk write caches and thus does not provide any\ndata integrity on systems with volatile disk write caches.\n\nSled is using it to achieve it's incredible speed, and the author is\naware of this warning. One of the commentors on the linked page\npoints out that RocksDB has special code to disable using the API on\nzfs. Pebble, which is a Go port/spinoff of RocksDB, takes the\napproach of opting-in ext4. Both RocksDB and Pebble seem to\nstill use fsync/fdatasync at various locations to ensure durability.\nI decided to look at PostgreSQL's source as well. They use sync_file_range()'s\nasynchronous mode to hint to the OS that the writes\nneed to be flushed, but they still issue fsync or fdatasync as needed.\nI also looked to SQLite's source: no references. I could not find any relevant\ndiscussion threads either.\nI'm not an expert on any of these databases, so my skim of their codebases\nshould be taken with a grain of salt.\nI tried finding any information about the reliability of sync_file_range for\ndurable overwrites on various filesystems, and I couldn't find anything except\nthese little bits already linked.\nLacking any definitive answer regarding whether it's able to provide durability\non any filesystems, I set out to test this myself.\n\n\n\n\n    Testing sync_file_range's durability\n    \n\nI set up an Ubuntu 20.04 Server virtual machine running kernel\n5.4.0-110-generic. While pondering how to best shut the machine down after the\ncall to sync_file_range, @justinj came to the rescue again by\npointing out that /proc/sysrq-trigger exists. He also shared his blog\npost where he performed similar tests against fsync while\nexploring how to build a durable database log.\nIt turns out if you write o to /proc/sysrq-trigger on a Linux machine\n(requires permissions), it will immediately power off. This greatly simplified\nmy testing setup.\nI executed a VM using this command:\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -drive file=ubuntu-server,format=qcow2 \\\n    -drive file=extra,format=qcow2 \\\n    -enable-kvm \\\n    -m 2G \\\n    -smp 1 \\\n    -device e1000,netdev=net0 \\\n    -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22\n\nIn another terminal, I executed the various examples from the repository over\nssh. After each example executed, the virtual machine would automatically\nreboot. By executing examples in a loop, I was able to run these commands for\nextended periods of time. My results are:\nFilesystemis sync_file_range durable?\nbtrfsNo\next4Yes\nxfsYes\nzfsNo\n\n\n\n\n\n    Safely extending a file's length while using sync_file_range\n    \n\nMy original testing of sync_file_range showed some failures, but after some\nadditional testing, I noticed it was only happening with either the first or\nsecond test, but never on subsequent tests for filesystems I've labeled durable\nabove.\nThere are two examples that test sync_file_range:\n\n\nsync_file_range.rs: When initializing the data file, zeroes are manually\nwritten to the file.\n\n\nsync_file_range_set_len.rs: When\ninitializing the data file, File::set_len() is called to extend the file,\nwhich is documented currently as:\n\nIf it is greater than the current fileâs size, then the file will be\nextended to size and have all of the intermediate data filled in with 0s.\n\n\n\nBoth examples use File::sync_all(), and both examples call File::sync_all on\nthe containing directories to sync the file length change.\nOn ext4 and xfs, my testing showed that I could reliably reproduce data loss on\nthe initial run in the sync_file_range_set_len example but not the\nsync_file_range example. Subsequent runs were durable. Why is that?\nDespite what the Rust documentation states, under the hood, File::set_len uses\nftruncate, which is documented as:\n\nIf the file size is increased, the extended area shall appear as if it were\nzero-filled.\n\nThe distinction between \"shall appear as if it were zero-filled\" and \"will be\nextended to size and have all of the intermediate data filled in with 0s\" is\nsubtle, but very important when considering the safety of sync_file_range. In\nmy earlier quote of sync_file_range's warning, the second emphasis also seems\nto relate to these findings.\nFrom my testing, using ftruncate to fill pages with 0 will conflict with\nsync_file_range on the first operation, but will likely succeed on future\ntests on ext4 and xfs.\n\n\n\n\n    Volatile Write Caches\n    \n\nUpdate 2022-05-23: A comment on Reddit correctly pointed\nout I skipped discussing this portion of the sync_file_range warning:\n\nThis system call does not flush disk write caches and thus does not provide\nany data integrity on systems with volatile disk write caches.\n\nEven with all of the aforementioned preconditions being true, we can't guarantee\nthat sync_file_range if write caching is enabled. This is because the device\nitself may have a write cache that is volatile. Unless write caching is\nexplicitly disabled, the only way for sync_file_range to be safe on ext4 and\nxfs is for the user to verify that the devices being used do not have volatile\nwrite caches.\nFor my NVME boot drive, I'm able to see that it has a volatile write cache:\n$ sudo nvme get-feature -f 6 /dev/nvme0n1\nget-feature:0x06 (Volatile Write Cache), Current value:0x00000001\n\nLet's turn it off and run our benchmark again:\n$ sudo nvme set-feature -f 6 -v 0 /dev/nvme0n1\nset-feature:0x06 (Volatile Write Cache), value:00000000, cdw12:00000000, save:0\n\nLabelavgminmaxstddevout%\nappend5.492ms5.123ms12.75ms564.1us0.016%\npreallocate2.763ms1.665ms11.75ms1.685ms0.006%\nsyncrange2.025ms1.592ms5.723ms910.1us0.064%\n\nOur sub-millisecond times have vanished. The only reason sync_file_range was\nfaster was because it was only writing to the volatile write cache. By disabling\nthe volatile write cache, the benefits of sync_file_range compared to the\npreallocation strategy diminish.\n\n\n\n\n    Conclusions about sync_file_range\n    \n\n\nsync_file_range is only safe to use on specific filesystems. Of the four I tested, xfs\nand ext4 appear to be completely reliable in their implementations, and\nzfs and btrfs both are completely unreliable in their implementations.\nsync_file_range is only safe to use on fully initialized pages.\nftruncate to extend a file does not fully initialize newly allocated pages\nwith zeroes and may take shortcuts instead. This makes using sync_file_range\non space allocated with ftruncate or similar operations unsafe to use.\nEven with all of these conditions being met, volatile write caches on the disk\nmust be disabled to ensure full durability.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Mac OS/iOS: Does F_BARRIERFSYNC provide durable writes?\n    \n\nNo. Apple's own documentation makes this clear:\n\nSome apps require a write barrier to ensure data persistence before subsequent\noperations can proceed. Most apps can use the fcntl(::) F_BARRIERFSYNC for\nthis.\nOnly use F_FULLFSYNC when your app requires a strong expectation of data\npersistence.\n\nGreat, so fnctl with F_FULLFSYNC is what is used to instead of fsync.\nLet's keep reading.\n\nNote that F_FULLFSYNC represents a best-effort guarantee that iOS writes data\nto the disk, but data can still be lost in the case of sudden power loss.\n\nApple really dropped the ball here. According to all available documentation I\ncan find: there is no way to run a truly ACID-compliant database on Mac OS. You\ncan get close, but a power loss could still result in a write being reported as\nsuccessfully persisted being gone after a power outage. A post on Michael\nTsai's blog covers the investigation into this in more detail.\nOne interesting note is that SQLite uses F_BARRIERFSYNC by default for all of\nits file synchronization on Mac/iOS. Optionally, you can use a #pragma to\nenable usage of F_FULLFSYNC. Given the relative overhead of the two APIs in my\nlimited testing, I can understand their decision, but I'm not sure it's the best\ndefault.\n\n\n\n\n    Windows: Are there any APIs for partially syncing files?\n    \n\nNo. Unless you are utilizing memory mapped files, the only API avialable on\nWindows is FlushFileBuffers.\n\n\n\n\n    What does all of this mean for BonsaiDb?\n    \n\nAstute readers may have noticed that the Nebari benchmarks claimed to be similar\nin performance to SQLite even post-sync changes. This is true on many metrics,\nbut it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, and the difference is the primary\nreason BonsaiDb slowed down.\nSQLite has many approaches to persistence, but let's look at the journaled\nversion as it's fairly straightforward. When using a journal, SQLite creates a\nfile that contains information needed to undo the changes its about to make to\nthe database file. To ensure a consistent state that can be recovered after a\npower outage at any point in this process, it must make at least two fsync\ncalls.\nNebari gets away with one fsync operation due to its append-only nature.\nHowever, the moment you use the Roots type, there's one more fsync operation:\nthe transaction log. Thus, Nebari isn't actually faster than SQLite when a\ntransaction log is used, which is a requirement for multi-tree transactions.\nThis is further exacerbated by Nebari's Multi-Reader, Single-Writer model of\ntransactions. If two threads are trying to write to the same tree, one will\nbegin its transaction and finish it while the other has to wait patiently for\nthe lock on the tree to be released.\nThis two-step sync method combined with contention over a few collections is\nwhat caused the Commerce Benchmark to grind to a halt after fsync was actually\ndoing real work. Individual worker threads would back up waiting for their turn\nto modify a collection.\nNebari's architecture was designed in October, and I spent countless hours\nprofiling and testing its performance. Due to the aforementioned issues with my\nmethodology, so many of my performance assumptions were flat out wrong.\n\n\n\n\n    What's next?\n    \n\nIt's clear from these results that whatever solution is picked for BonsaiDb, it\nneeds to support a way to allow multiple transactions to proceed at the same\ntime. This is a much tougher problem to solve, and I'm uncertain I want to\ntackle this problem myself.\nFor the longest time, I developed BonsaiDb with minimal \"advertising.\" Imposter\nsyndrome prevented me from sharing it for most of 2021. Over the alpha period, I\nfinally started feeling confidence in its reliability. Now, I'm back to\nquestioning whether I should attempt a new version of Nebari.\nOn one hand, seeing that Nebari is still pretty fast after fixing this bug\nshould prove to me that I can write a fast database. On the other hand, I'm so\nembarrassed I didn't notice these issues earlier, and it's demoralizing to think\nof all the time spent building upon mistaken assumptions. Nebari will also need\nto transition to a more complex architecture, which makes it lose some of the\nappeal I had for it.\nThe only thing I can say with confidence right now is that I still firmly\nbelieve in my vision of BonsaiDb, regardless of what storage layer powers it. I\nwill figure out my plans soon so that existing users aren't left in a lurch for\ntoo long.\nLastly, I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported me through\nthis journey. Despite the recent stress, BonsaiDb and Nebari have been fun and\nrewarding projects to build.\n","id":"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/durable-writes/","title":"BonsaiDb performance update: A deep-dive on file synchronization"},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/february-2022-update/":{"body":"\nWhat is BonsaiDb?\nBonsaiDb is a new database aiming to be the most developer-friendly\nRust database. BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nIt's the last weekend of the month, and I want to make it a habit at the end of\neach month to reflect on the previous month as well as talk about what I'm\ncurrently focused on or what is coming next.\n\n\n\n\n    Status of the Alpha\n    \n\nI released our initial alpha on February 5. I am ecstatic with the warm\nreception. Our Discord server has grown with several active users who\nhave been running BonsaiDb through its paces. Several bugs have been discovered\nand fixed, with these releases happening in February:\n\nv0.1.0: Initial alpha release.\nv0.1.1: Derive macros for common traits, many documentation\nimprovements, and memory-only databases for testing purposes.\nv0.1.2: Worked\naround an undocumented panic within tokio::sleep on Windows that a user\nexperienced. Upstream patch merged as well.\nv0.2.0: Custom\nprimary keys, LZ4\ncompression, and other minor improvements.\n\nIn addition to these releases, the underlying storage layer (Nebari)\nhas been updated as well with several new features, bug fixes, and performance\nimprovements. The primary performance improvements that have been released have\ncentered around better usage of Rust's type system to avoid extra allocations.\n\n\n\n\n    Derive Macros\n    \n\n@ModProg noticed that I had open issues for adding derive macros for\nsome common traits. He became the second contributor to the BonsaiDb repository\nwhen these macros were added in v0.1.1.\nI have an important design philosophy with BonsaiDb: Everything should be as\nergonomic as possible without macros. Macros should be used to improve an\nalready-well-designed API. I was comfortable writing\nschemas by hand, but I recognized how often I copy and pasted boilerplate code\nand then tweaked small portions -- a good sign that a macro would help!\nThe way these macros are written is using a new crate @ModProg wrote:\nattribute-derive. I've made a few\nupdates to the macros since his pull request, and it's been a wonderful\nexperience. If you are looking into writing an attribute proc macro, you might\nwant to consider using this crate to make simplify parsing and support more\nRust-y syntaxes.\n\n\n\n\n    Supporting BonsaiDb\n    \n\nI've tried to be very responsive to all questions, feedback, and issues. It's\nfun seeing BonsaiDb evaluated in new ways. As I recalled in the LZ4 Compression\nfeature introduction, I introduced that feature the day after a\npotential user ran into space issues when evaluating BonsaiDb against their\ncurrent Sled code.\n@ModProg one morning tried running BonsaiDb on a Raspberry Pi, which\nled to us diagnosing a bug/edge case that's been fixed in the sysinfo\ncrate. It was a fun\nmorning debugging BonsaiDb, an async codebase, over a Discord screenshare\nshowing an ssh session into the Raspberry Pi running GDB!\nA few days ago, the same user that was testing a somewhat large dataset reported\nan issue. It turned out to be a long-standing\nbug\nin Nebari's transaction log reading code. The unit tests were inadequate, and\nthe only reason it was noticed was due to the LZ4 decompression failing once a\ntransaction log entry was large enough to be stored compressed across multiple\npages. The associated data isn't currently being used outside of the\nlist_executed_transactions() function, but eventually is planned to be a core\npart of replication. A cargo update is all that is needed for BonsaiDb to\nadopt the updated version of Nebari.\n\n\n\n\n    Testing BonsaiDb with a large dataset\n    \n\nDespite the bug that was just found, I still felt fairly confident in BonsaiDb's\nstability. Yet, it showed I hadn't really tested a big dataset. With a user\ntrying to use BonsaiDb with a large dataset, I felt like I should do my own\ntesting to feel as confident in BonsaiDb's abilities as I can be.\nAfter looking through a few locations, I stumbled upon the Open Library Data\nDumps. The data set I'm going to talk\nabout in this post contains these entities:\nCollectionRecords\nAuthors9,145,605\nEditions33,102,390\nWorks24,010,896\n\nThe uncompressed file that this data is loaded from is 51,447mb. It contains\nadditional data from the types listed, so direct size comparisons aren't able to\nbe done post-import.\nWriting an importer was a fun project. Since the data being imported is too\nlarge to read into RAM before processing, I started with a streaming TSV\nparser\nthat uses flume to send parsed records to another task. This uses a\nbounded channel which will park the TSV parser thread if it outpaces the code\nthat saves the records to the disk.\nThe data importing logic is fairly straightforward. I have one method that\nreceives records from the TSV parser and creates batched\ntransactions.\nImporting the data with LZ4 compression enabled took 60m56s, and with\ncompression disabled it took 64m12s. The resulting file sizes are interesting:\nCollectionLZ4 UncompactedLZ4 CompactedUncompactedCompacted\nAuthors13,316mb3,675mb23,508mb4,159mb\nEditions74,459mb33,155mb118,330mb38,372mb\nWorks40,443mb12,082mb71,601mb13,565mb\n\nBonsaiDb uses Nebari, which uses an append-only file format for its\ndatabase. As the internal trees are built, old nodes are left behind on disk.\nThe only way to reclaim the disk space currently is to compact the database -- a\nprocess which rewrites all the active data to a fresh file and swaps the files\natomically once fully synchronized. Compacting the compressed database took\n6m55s, and compacting the uncompressed database took 7m20s.\nAfter testing importing and overwriting the database several times, my\nconfidence level in BonsaiDb grew. I built a simple CLI that allows querying\nauthors, editions, and works by their unique ID. Everything was working great.\n\n\n\n\n    Querying large datasets with views\n    \n\nI wanted to add support to show all the books (works) that an author wrote.\nIn the data coming from OpenLibrary, the Work type has a list of author roles.\nThis is the\nView\ndefinition that enables this query:\n#[derive(View, Debug, Clone)]\n#[view(name = \"by-author\", collection = Work, key = String, value = u32)]\nstruct WorksByAuthor;\n\nimpl CollectionViewSchema for WorksByAuthor {\n    type View = Self;\n\n    fn map(\n        &amp;self,\n        document: CollectionDocument&lt;&lt;Self::View as View&gt;::Collection&gt;,\n    ) -&gt; ViewMapResult&lt;Self::View&gt; {\n        document\n            .contents\n            .authors\n            .into_iter()\n            .filter_map(|role| role.author)\n            .map(|author| {\n                document\n                    .header\n                    .emit_key_and_value(author.into_key().replace(\"/a/\", \"/authors/\"), 1)\n            })\n            .collect()\n    }\n}\n\nThe data has some sanitization issues, including that keys sometimes are\nshortened from /authors/UNIQUEID to /a/UNIQUEID. Because importing the data\ntakes so long, I chose to clean up the data post-import rather than force myself\nto re-run the import with some code to clean it up while importing.\nThe entire function to display an author in the CLI is:\nasync fn summarize(&amp;self, database: &amp;Database) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    if let Some(name) = &amp;self.name {\n        println!(\"Name: {}\", name);\n    }\n    if let Some(bio) = &amp;self.bio {\n        println!(\"Biography:\\n{}\", bio.value())\n    }\n    let works = database\n        .view::&lt;WorksByAuthor&gt;()\n        .with_key(self.key.clone())\n        .query_with_collection_docs()\n        .await?;\n    if !works.is_empty() {\n        println!(\"Works:\");\n        for work in works.documents.values() {\n            if let Some(title) = &amp;work.contents.title {\n                println!(\"{}: {}\", work.contents.key, title)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWhile this was easy to implement, I knew that this was going to be a painful\nprocess to run. BonsaiDb's views are lazily evaluated (with the exception of\nunique views). The first time the view is accessed, the view will need to have\nit's map() function invoked for each document stored in the collection. For\nthe Works collection, that means processing 24 million rows.\nThe initial query took over an hour. Subsequent queries are fast: the time open-library author OL1394865A command completes in less than 400ms once the\nview is indexed.\nI really wanted to be able to turn this example into a benchmarking suite, and\nthe only way to do that without driving myself crazy was to start optimizing.\n\n\n\n\n    Optimizing View Mapping\n    \n\nThe initial implementation of the view mapper was aimed at being correct, not\nnecessarily fast. It was originally designed to operate within\nSled, which allowed non-transactional reads and writes. The\nthought was that I could simply parallelize some loops and magically the view\nmapping system would be faster because Sled would handle ensuring the data was\nwritten to disk correctly with multi-threaded writes.\nAfter switching to Nebari, the view mapper always runs in a\ntransactional context. Each view mapping operation created its own transaction\n-- the slowest way to write to the database. The biggest priority was going to\nbe to refactor the view mapper to batch the operations into larger transactions.\nMy initial refactoring did just\nthat\nand lowered the execution time significantly (~70%), but it also introduced a subtle\nbug. As a result, not all mappings were being saved, but I\ndidn't notice the issue until much later in the refactoring process.\nOne issue I was running into is that Nebari's TransactionTree required an\nexclusive borrow on the ExecutingTransaction. This prevented being able to read\ndocuments in one thread while writing view entries in another thread. I\nrefactored Nebari's transaction handling\ncode\nto allow this sort of parallelization.\nAfter adopting the new\nfunctionality,\nhere are the view mapping times on the compressed dataset:\nCollectionSizeViewUnoptimized (LZ4)Optimized (LZ4)OptimizedUncompactedCompacted\nWorks12,082mbWorksByAuthor1h02m03s10m16s10m13s16,241mb1,863mb\nEditions33,155mbEditionsByWork26m52s12m23s12m48s17,507mb3,396mb\n\nWhile preparing this post, I've re-run the pre-optimized code and optimized code\nto verify my notes on timings. When initially starting work on optimization, I\nhadn't implemented EditionsByWork. I've verified the output of both\nunoptimized versions and optimized versions match a random set of entries that\nI've compared against their website. To clarify some of the numbers: all sizes\nlisted above are the compressed sizes. Adding all sizes made the table too large\nto be easily understood.\nAt this stage, I no longer have any low hanging fruit from an algorithm\nperspective. The next step in optimization would be to start profiling, but I've\nreached my initial goals, so I'm going to be focusing on wrapping up this pull\nrequest by finishing this\nexample. I would enjoy turning this into a benchmark suite, but I'm also not\nexcited at the prospects of how long such a suite would take to debug fully.\n\n\n\n\n    Next steps for BonsaiDb\n    \n\nI'm going to continue prioritizing any stability or performance issues as they\nare reported. There have been a few repeated requests that I'm going to be\nworking on soon: \"best practices\" overview, internal archicture documentation,\nand a high-level roadmap.\nSeveral people have expressed interest in learning more about BonsaiDb's\ninternals and roadmap with a goal of potentially contributing. I will be working\non those requests soon. In the meantime, I want to extend my offer to anyone\nreading this: if you have any questions about any part of BonsaiDb, don't\nhesitate to ask! Regardless of your experience with Rust, if you're excited at\nthe idea of helping build BonsaiDb, I will be happy to help you get up to speed.\nAside from improved documentation and project planning, I was working on\nbuilding a persistent job\nqueue, which I will be\nreturning to and hopefully ship in March. I'm building this feature as a\nstandalone crate that will allow users to create independent job queues with\ndifferent job distribution strategies, and the long-term goal is for this crate\nto be the first \"plugin\" for BonsaiDb.\n\n\n\n\n    Getting Started\n    \n\nOur homepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples. We have started writing a user's\nguide, and we have tried to write good\ndocumentation.\nWe would love to hear from you if you have questions or feedback. We have\ncommunity Discourse forums and a Discord\nserver, but also welcome anyone to open an\nissue with any questions or\nfeedback.\nWe dream big with BonsaiDb, and we believe that it can simplify\nwriting and deploying complex, data-driven applications in Rust. We would love\nadditional\ncontributors\nwho have similar passions and ambitions.\nLastly, if you build something with one of our libraries, we would love to hear\nabout it. Nothing makes us happier than hearing people are building things with\nour crates!\n","id":"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/february-2022-update/","title":"BonsaiDb February update: Supporting and Optimizing BonsaiDb"},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/january-2022-update/":{"body":"BonsaiDb is a pure Rust database that grows with you. It already is feature-rich, but we are still working towards our initial alpha. This month's update will highlight the changes since the last update and cover what's remaining before our alpha release.\nHighlighted updates\nI have made 90 commits (+8,406/-3,097) since last month's update. Many improvements have been made based on feedback from early adopters. Thank you to everyone who has asked a question, reported an issue, or provided any feedback!\n\n\n\n\n    Key-Value Store Optimization\n    \n\nI firmly believe in under-promising and over-delivering. So when I was writing the about page originally, I had to clarify in the Key-Value section that the performance was limited by the current design. As such, I decided I would prefer to go ahead and implement the design proposed in that issue.\nThe Key-Value store is meant to perform atomic operations with reasonable durability. This is the primary difference between the goals of the Key-Value store and Collection storage. The Key-Value store is meant to be a good alternative to running Redis, and Redis uses a delayed persistence design.\nI've copied the general design of how persistence works, except that with BonsaiDb the database isn't kept in memory constantly. This means that BonsaiDb's Key-Value store can contain more data than the RAM on your machine, something that is possible but not recommended with Redis.\nBy default, BonsaiDb will persist each operation after it's performed. This can cause a lot of extra disk IO if thousands of operations are being performed per second. Additionally, it can cause file bloat due to the append-only file format utilized. Instead, it's recommended to configure persistence such that writes are delayed based on what you feel is a good balance for your use case. For example:\nStorage::open(\n    StorageConfiguration::new(&amp;database_directory)\n        .key_value_persistence(KeyValuePersistence::lazy([\n            PersistenceThreshold::after_changes(1)\n    .and_duration(Duration::from_secs(5)),\n            PersistenceThreshold::after_changes(10),\n  ])\n)\n\nThis configuration has two rules: persist after 5 seconds if there is at least 1 change, and perist if there are at least 200 changes. This means if BonsaiDb unexpectedly is killed, at most the most recent 5 seconds of changes would be lost. However, if a batch of changes is written, they will be persisted immediately.\nSo, how does the key-value store perform compared to Redis?\n\nWell, as you might expect, if you don't have network access, things go very fast -- measured in nanoseconds on my personal computer. However, the networking performance leaves something to be desired. After doing a lot of profiling, I could see that the TLS for the QUIC connection accounts for roughly 30% of the time spent. However, that still is a little slower than the WebSocket implementation, which in turn is significantly slower than Redis.\nMy profiling has led me to believe that switching to Socketto will bring the WebSocket implementation closer by reducing the number of allocations. Only time will tell if that will match Redis's performance, but I'm hopeful it will be close enough to not care. For the QUIC connection, our other major contributor has plans to dig in and see what can be done to reduce some of the allocations we saw in the profiling we did.\n\n\n\n\n    Collection Benchmarks\n    \n\nEdit 2022-05-25: These benchmarks were discovered to have serious problems.\nRead more here.\nMy last blog post goes into detail about a new benchmark I wrote to attempt to simulate a simple relational database workload. The results were staggering to me.\n\nNearly every operation across every workload showed all ways of accessing BonsaiDb outperforming PostgreSQL significantly.\n\n\n\n\n    Rethinking Serialization\n    \n\nOne problem that I had with BonsaiDb is that I didn't want to force users into a specific serialization format. The base document type contains a buffer of bytes -- you can store whatever you'd like as a document. I believe our new serialization format, Pot, is a great choice, but there are very good reasons to make it easy to support any serialization format.\nThis month I spent time creating Transmog, my take on an approach to universal serialization traits. This project aims at creating a common interface that most serialization formats could offer an implementation of. By leveraging transmog, BonsaiDb's SerializedCollection trait can be used to automatically serialize and deserialize your collection types for you regardless of the format you're storing them as. Additionally, View value serialization is now powered by Transmog, as our hdrhistogram view example demonstrates:\n/// A view for [`Samples`] which produces a histogram.\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct AsHistogram;\n\nimpl View for AsHistogram {\n    type Collection = Samples;\n    type Key = u64;\n    type Value = SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt;;\n\n    fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; Name {\n        Name::new(\"as-histogram\")\n    }\n}\n\nimpl SerializedView for AsHistogram {\n    type Format = Self;\n\n    fn format() -&gt; Self::Format {\n        Self\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Format&lt;'static, SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt;&gt; for AsHistogram {\n    type Error = HistogramError;\n\n    fn serialize_into&lt;W: std::io::Write&gt;(\n        &amp;self,\n        value: &amp;SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt;,\n        mut writer: W,\n    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Self::Error&gt; {\n        V2Serializer::new()\n            .serialize(value, &amp;mut writer)\n            .map_err(HistogramError::Serialization)?;\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nimpl OwnedDeserializer&lt;SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt;&gt; for AsHistogram {\n    fn deserialize_from&lt;R: std::io::Read&gt;(\n        &amp;self,\n        mut reader: R,\n    ) -&gt; Result&lt;SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt;, Self::Error&gt; {\n        hdrhistogram::serialization::Deserializer::new()\n            .deserialize(&amp;mut reader)\n            .map(SyncHistogram::from)\n            .map_err(HistogramError::Deserialization)\n    }\n}\n\nThis example shows how using Transmog we're able to use the custom serialization functions built into the hdrhistogram crate. Querying the view returns a SyncHistogram&lt;u64&gt; directly:\nlet total_histogram = db.view::&lt;AsHistogram&gt;().reduce().await?;\nprintln!(\n \"99th Percentile overall: {} ({} samples)\",\n total_histogram.value_at_quantile(0.99),\n total_histogram.len()\n);\n\nI think this example shows the inredible power of our map/reduce views and the Rust type system.\n\n\n\n\n    Alpha coming next week\n    \n\nI had a chat this morning with our other major contributor, (@daxpedda), to try to understand the implications of the breaking changes coming in the OPAQUE-KE crate. The result of the conversation was this issue to implement traditional password hashing. The first alpha will not contain OPAQUE as we're going to wait until an update supporting  draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-07 is released. This is one of the things he's been working hard on for months, and he's near the point where we can integrate the changes into BonsaiDb!\nHowever, as OPAQUE is still a draft specification, there is too much possibility that things will break again in the future before being stabilized. We will help support these upgrades, but it's not going to be the best administration experience, and it will potentially require utilizing multiple crate versions in the long run.\nOnce I swap out this implementation, I'm going to be creating a 0.1 branch in the repository. We will be using the 0.x version range for our alpha and beta phases and eventually release 1.0 as the first stable version.\nI will ask early adopters to check it out ahead of releasing to crates.io at the end of next week. I'll send out a message on our Discord as well as update this issue once the branch is available.\nIn the meantime, our homepage has basic getting started information including a full list of examples. I look forward to hearing what people build with BonsaiDb!\n\nHave questions or comments?

BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\nToday marks the one year anniversary of the initial commit to\nBonsaiDb. This project is largely a written by me (@Ecton),\nalthough I'm very thankful to have been accompanied along the way by\n@daxpedda. He is responsible for the QUIC networking\nlayer, our currently removed OPAQUE-KE support, and above all,\ncountless long discussions and debates that not only led to starting this\nproject, but also to the easy-to-use API designs we have today.\nIn the last few months, we've also had two additional contributors:\n@ModProg and @vbmade2000. I'm grateful for their\nadditions to the project, and I hope this year we see even more contributors as\nBonsaiDb gains momentum.\n\n\n\n\n    Beginning a real bonsai cluster\n    \n\nThe name BonsaiDb was suggested by @daxpedda after countless times\nwhere we stumbled trying to pronounce the project's former name: PliantDb. When\nI announced the new name, I researched trying to grow a bonsai\ntree in the Las Vegas climate. My initial findings were that many of the iconic\ntypes are difficult to grow here, and I ended up shelving the idea.\nAs March was approaching, I knew I wanted to commemorate the anniversary of the\nfirst commit. I researched again and found two species that were great\ncandidates for being able to be grown mostly indoors. After some deliberation, I\ndecided to start with a Golden Gate (Tiger Bark) Ficus:\n\nAfter giving the tree another week or two of adjustment to its new home, I'll be\npruning it for the first time and attempting to grow a second tree from its\ncuttings. Within the limits of being able to provide good living conditions for\neach tree, I hope to expand the \"cluster\" each year and will share progress\npictures along the way!\n\n\n\n\n    The first year: Inspiration\n    \n\nThe inspiration for BonsaiDb came from weeks and weeks of\ndiscussions between myself and @daxpedda. We were wanting\nto build an cluster architecture for an MMO that:\n\nWas easy to deploy and maintain\nWas affodable\nCould scale horizontally\nCould subdivide players by \"location\" within the cluster:\n\nEach location could have database/cache/cpu resources allocated dynamically\nEach location would be Highly Available\n\n\nUsed as many Rust-written solutions as possible\n\nAt the start of our discussions, I was dead-set on using PostgreSQL and Redis\nfor our database/caching needs. However both PostgreSQL and Redis aren't easy to\ndeploy and maintain in a highly available cluster, and if I chose managed\nsolutions, they definitely weren't affordable.\nWhen starting my last company, I chose CouchDB for various reasons\nthat aren't worth diving into. Through the ten years of growing that company, I\nbecame intimately familiar with the simple yet powerful design of CouchDB.\nSeveral times I pondered rewriting CouchDB atop PostgreSQL using JSONB columns\nto see how it would perform. I never ended up taking any of those prototypes\nvery far, but the thought process helped me appreciate and understand CouchDB's\ninner workings better.\nOne day while working on Cosmic Verge, it dawned on me: I had\nbuilt a small wrapper around Sled that made it feel like a higher-level\ndatabase. What if I went further and built a CouchDB-like API atop Sled?\n\n\n\n\n    The first year: Initial Goals\n    \n\nInitially, I was hesitant to tell anyone I was building a database. Despite\nrelying on Sled for the low-level transactional storage, it still felt\nlike one of those projects that is usually ill-advised. I finally felt confident\nenough in my reasoning of why I was building BonsaiDb that I wrote a detailed\ndevlog describing the motivation for tackling this new\nproject.\nEarly on, I never had high ambitions for BonsaiDb. After all, this was the first\ndatabase I had ever written. The likelihood of me building a high-performance\ndatabase seemed low. Instead, I wanted to focus primarily on developer\nexperience, reliability, and ease of deployment. I tried to make intelligent\nchoices based on my expectations of what would be efficient, but I intentionally\navoided comparing BonsaiDb against other databases until January of this\nyear.\nTo me the selling points of BonsaiDb were (and still are):\n\nStraightforward to use and deploy.\nCan write generic code that works regardless of how BonsaiDb is deployed.\n\"Battery-powered\" with common needs for developers, reducing complexity of deployments:\n\nACID-compliant transactional document storage\nLightweight Atomic Key-Value store (a-la Redis)\nPubSub\nUnified and extensible authentication and permissions model\nPersistent Job Queue System (a la SQS/Resque/Sidekiq). Work on this has been\nstarted but is not shipping yet, but it has been a goal from the start of\nthe project.\n\n\nBuilt in Rust, for Rust.\nVision includes a \"grows with you\" pitch:\n\nBi-directional replication\nQuorum-based clustering\nModular plugin system to support \"resuable\" collections and services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    BonsaiDb isn't just a toy\n    \n\nIn October a series of events made me look at porting the append-only B-Tree\nimplementation from CouchDB to Rust as a potential replacement for Sled\nin our architecture. In the end, the bug that I was experiencing on Mac was\nunrelated to Sled, but its symptoms manifested in such a way that\nresembled issues others have had with Sled in the past.\nAfter getting some basic unit tests working, I did something really stupid: I\nbenchmarked it against Sled and SQLite. Why was it stupid? It kicked off a\nviscious few weeks, nearly reaffirming the common wisdom: why was I trying to\nwrite my own database? I would stare at microbenchmarks and\nprofiling results, tweak something, and try again. Over and over. For some\nreason it just wasn't occurring to me: the fact Nebari was even in the\nsame realm as these highly optimized databases was exciting enough. Eventually,\nI convinced myself it was better for the future of BonsaiDb to\nadopt Nebari.\nIn January I was preparing to release our first alpha. I knew if I didn't have\nbenchmarks available, it would be one of the first questions asked. I wrote a\nbenchmark suite aimed at comparing BonsaiDb against PostgreSQL in a simple\neCommerce setup. I wasn't prepared for the results: BonsaiDb is significantly\nfaster than PostgreSQL in this benchmark suite.\nLast month I set my focus testing large datasets and was able\nto achieve performance again that exceeded my expectations. I no longer am\nviewing BonsaiDb as an easy-to-use database that will be \"good enough\" for many\npeople. I now view BonsaiDb as having the potential to be a serious database\noption for most people.\nFor being just one year old, I'm extremely happy with where BonsaiDb is today.\n\n\n\n\n    Year Two: My Goals\n    \n\nOne thing that surprised me was how much interest Nebari garnered.\nDespite not heavily advertising it, it's accumulated a fair number of stars on\nGitHub. It's popular enough that I've been rethinking how I was planning on\nimplementing certain features. Outside of bug fixes and minor features, I\nhaven't spent much time working on Nebari as it has been meeting BonsaiDb's\nneeds. I would like to spend more time in this coming year making Nebari a\nbetter crate for developers to consume directly. Ultimately, the more users\nNebari has, the more confidence everyone can have in BonsaiDb's ACID compliance.\nFor BonsaiDb, there are several goals I have:\n\n\nFeatures, Features, Features: I'm excited at exploring a wide variety of\nfeatures aiming to make BonsaiDb more powerful and easier to use:\n\nAbility to use BonsaiDb in non-async\ncode\nPersistent Job Queue\nSupporting Metrics\nDocument Dependencies/Foreign Keys/Graph Relationships\nCollection Lifecycles\nReplication\n\nThere are countless other features I hope to explore as well, but those are\nsome of the higher priority items as I view them.\n\n\nStability: I would like to be able to declare a stable version within the\nnext year. I'm currently treating BonsaiDb as if it's stable: trying to\npreserve backwards compatibility for the storage format, prioritizing bug\nfixes, and keeping a thorough changelog.\nBy this time next year, I would like to be at a point where the core of\nBonsaiDb is changing infrequently, and focus is on building higher level\nabstractions.\n\n\nTooling: A good, graphical database administration tool not only makes\nexploring a database more approachable, it also can aide in quickly diagnosing\nand fixing data issues. Because BonsaiDb is architected to not know about the\ncontents of the documents being stored, creating a good, generic\nadministration tool will be a fun challenge.\n\n\nCommunity: Fostering an active developer community around BonsaiDb is\nimportant for many reasons. As I mentioned before, the more users BonsaiDb\nhas, the more confident we can all feel about its reliability. Beyond that,\nhowever, is something more fundamental for me: I thrive on success stories and\nhelping solve interesting data problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Help grow BonsaiDb\n    \n\nBuilding BonsaiDb has reawakened many of the passions I felt in my first\nfull-time computer-related job: working on REALbasic (now\nXojo). As I started getting schema design questions and\nfeature requests from potential users, I reflected on the joy those interactions\nprovided me. It is clear to me that one of the reasons I look back so fondly at\nmy first programming job is the wide array of problems I helped users solve.\nFor the longest time, I held off on allowing any means of sponsoring development\nof BonsaiDb. Until recently, I was still hoping to get back to writing an MMO\nonce BonsaiDb was mature enough. My dreams have changed in the past months: I\nwant to focus on bringing safe, high-level data-oriented application development\nto Rust. Initially, that means getting BonsaiDb to a maturity level where it\nmeets my original vision.\nMany readers may not be aware that the early days of BonsaiDb development were\noverlapped with my development of Gooey. To this day, it is the only\nframework that meets my personal desires of application development. However,\nit's lacking many critical features/widgets. I paused development because I want\nto focus on BonsaiDb. Yet, I also want to begin writing GUI administration tools\nfor BonsaiDb soon.\nI would love to continue dedicating my focus to these areas of the Rust ecosystem:\n\nBonsaiDb: Easy-to-use database that grows with you.\nBuilding cross-platform applications in Rust (with or without Gooey)\n\nIf you would like to ensure my ability to continue working on these projects\nfull-time, I am now accepting sponsorship through GitHub\nSponsors. I have been working on open-source Rust projects since\nNovember 2019 all funded by the sale of my previous startup. I would love the\nopportunity to continue working on open-source full time without needing to\nfocus on building another startup. As I am not in dire need of finances, please\nonly sponsor me if you have truly disposable income.\nAnother important way to help grow BonsaiDb is to contribute. I've been working\non adding \"Good First Issue\" tasks. If you're looking to\ncontribute to an open-source Rust project, I would be honored to have you as\npart of our team.\n\n\n\n\n    Trying out BonsaiDb\n    \n\nOur homepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples. We have started writing a user's\nguide, and we have tried to write good\ndocumentation.\nI would love to hear from you if you have questions or feedback. We have\ncommunity Discourse forums and a Discord\nserver, but also welcome anyone to open an\nissue with any questions or\nfeedback.\nLastly, if you build something with one of our libraries, we would love to hear\nabout it. Nothing makes us happier than hearing people are building things with\nour crates!\nThank you to all of the wonderful people in the Khonsu Labs community and the\nRust ecosystem.\n","id":"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/one-year-anniversary/","title":"A Year of BonsaiDb: A retrospective and looking to the future"},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/optimizing-bonsaidb-p1/":{"body":"\nWhat is BonsaiDb?\nBonsaiDb is a new database aiming to be the most developer-friendly\nRust database. BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common\ndata problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: What is\nBonsaiDb?.\n\n\n\n\n\n    First, a Thank You\n    \n\nMy last post covered how a couple of small but\nimpactful mistakes severely impacted BonsaiDb's performance. The\nnumerous supportive messages and comments I received was truly humbling. Thank\nyou everyone who took the time to reach out in any way.\nI had two goals with that post: to let anyone using or considering BonsaiDb\nknow of the issue, and to reassure any users or potential users that I was\nconfident in improving BonsaiDb's performance.\nAt the time of writing that post, my ideas on how to improve performance were\nhalf-formed, and I didn't have any confidence in what sort of speedups I could\nachieve. I was excited to experiment, but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts.\nThere are two things that have helped me gain enough confidence to start sharing\nwhat I've been working on: the numerous heartwarming messages and comments, and\nmaking meaningful progress in testing my ideas.\nToday's post covers how I've improved Nebari's transaction batching to\nbe able to achieve a higher number of transactions per second. I will then\nfollow up by discussing how a new format for Nebari might be able to close the\nremaining performance gap between BonsaiDb and PostgreSQL.\n\n\n\n\n    The goal of improving batching\n    \n\nNebari's current transaction batching supports multiple transactions against\ndifferent trees (a, b, and c):\n\nIn the above example, threads 1, 2 and 3 all begin a transaction against\ndifferent trees. Because they are all different trees, all threads are able to\noperate simultaneously. Once a transaction is committed, it must be added to the\ntransaction log. The transaction manager automatically will batch multiple\ntransactions together.\nLet's see what happens when these threads all try to modify the same tree instead (a):\n\nThread 1 acquires the lock on tree a, causing the other two threads to wait\nuntil its released. This doesn't happen in Nebari today until the transaction is\nfully confirmed. This is the problem that the Commerce Benchmark is BonsaiDb was\nexhibiting: transactions would cause backlogs to form until most workers were\nblocked waiting on other transactions to complete -- often serially.\nWhat if we could enable this sort of pipelining:\n\nThe above sequence of operations still only allows each thread access to the\ntree for writing one at a time, perserving Nebari's current single-writer\nphilosophy. The transactional guarantees are still the same: no transaction is\nconfirmed complete until it is fully synchronized. The change is that there's\nnow a little more state in-memory to keep track of multiple versions of the\nstate -- enabling true Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).\nI set out on Sunday afternoon to try this new approach.\n\n\n\n\n    Initial Results: Pretty good\n    \n\nYesterday just in time for my lunch break, I reached a point where I could\nbenchmark my new transaction batching code. I am running a specific\nprofile of the Commerce Benchmark using 16 worker agents, which means the\ndatabase is trying to process requests from 16 threads simultaneously.\nBackendCPU TimeWall Time\nbonsaidb v0.4.1377.2s23.57s\nrefactor from last blog post320.1s20.01s\nnew approach44.91s2.807s\npostgresql18.25s1.141s\n\nBonsaiDb v0.4.1 takes over 6 minutes of CPU time to complete. After these\nchanges, BonsaiDb is able to complete the bechmark in ~45 seconds. This is\nclearly a huge win. However, PostgreSQL still takes less than half the time,\nso there's still room for improvement. For those who are curious to dive in\nbeyond the summary, I've uploaded the benchmark report of the new approach.\nI compared the timeline view of profiling data in Hotspot:\n\nI recognize this image might be hard to read on mobile devices. Clicking the\nimage will allow you to see it at full resolution. Both timelines are zoomed in\nto show 100ms of activityq. On the left is BonsaiDb v0.4.1 and on the right is\nthe updated code.\nThe orange colored parts are where CPU samples were taken. The green areas are\nwhere those threads have no samples -- they were blocked. It's clear at a quick\nglance that there are a lot more orange areas on the right side, which is what\nwe'd expect given the higher throughput.\nThe other observation to note is the transaction log's thread activity.\nTheoretically, that thread's activity should be roughtly the same, as it was and\nstill will be bottlenecked by file flushing. The thread that is highlighted blue\nis the transaction log thread. While there is variation between the graphs, the\namount of activity and the space between them is roughly the same on average.\nThat is exactly what I was expecting to see.\nNow, Nebari is bottlenecked by the frequency of flushes, and the Commerce\nBenchmark is reaching its performance limit due to only having a fixed number of\nworker agents. Once all agents are waiting on a transaction, everything is\nblocked until the next batch is committed.\n\n\n\n\n    Where's the remaining performance\n    \n\nOne challenge that Nebari faces with the current format is that the transaction\nlog does not record which trees were involved in the transaction. If we can't\nguarantee that all trees are fully flushed before we write the transaction log,\nwe need some way to know upon loading the transaction log that the latest log\nentry is valid. Because we don't currently have a list of trees in the log\nitself, there's no way for the log to validate the latest log.\nThis is why the transaction log requires that all trees are fully flushed before\nbeing written itself. If the log format were changed, we could add a list of\ncommitted trees to each entry. This would be all that's needed to allow Nebari\nto perform a single flush per transaction batch, which should nearly double the\nthroughput with the current design. However, I suspect that wouldn't be enough\nto fully match PostgreSQL's performance.\nPostgreSQL, as well as many other database engines, pre-allocate chunks of\nstorage rather than appending to the end of the file for each write.\nAdditionally, when data is freed, other engines will often reuse that space. In\nthe previous blog post, I included some results from a\nbenchmark showing how preallocating can drastically reduce overall write times.\nConverting Nebari into a format that can preallocate yet still remain\nappend-only is one approach, but I'm not certain it's worth the effort. Because\nthe above changes necessitate a format upgrade, I feel like my best option would\nbe to re-evaluate my options for how Nebari works to try to achieve the best\nresults.\n\n\n\n\n    Designing a new storage format for Nebari\n    \n\nDespite Nebari being designed as an append-only format, the majority of the code\nbase interacts with the file using two functions: read_chunk() and\nwrite_chunk().\nwrite_chunk() writes a series of bytes to the file and returns a u64. This\nnumber is the offset into the file that the data is stored at, but all of the\nB+Tree code treats this number as an opaque ID. The only way it is used is with\nsubsequent calls to read_chunk().\nBecause this abstraction exists, it seems pretty clear that the new format's API\nshould look something like:\n\nAbility to write one or more chunks of data in parallel with other writers,\nwith each chunk of data being assigned a unique id.\nAbility to ask for all the pending writes to be flushed.\nAbility to store a \"root\" header.\nAbility to retrieve a previously stored chunk of data using its id.\n\nMy overall goals of this new underlying storage layer would be:\n\nUses a single flush operation for integrity.\nSupports multiple concurrent readers and writers.\nPreallocates disk space in chunks.\nDisk space can be released and reused.\n\nIf such a format could be built, it would be a fairly trivial operation to port\nNebari to it.\n\n\n\n\n    Sediment: A new foundation for Nebari\n    \n\nSediment is my mostly-still-theorized file format that is aimed at\nproviding the API and goals outlined above.\nSediment will use a single-file architecture that allows storing blobs of data\nwith ACID compliance. Each stored blob is assigned a GrainId which can be used\nto retrieve the data or release the data in the future.\nSediment follows my neverending need to name things in cute but meaningful ways.\nThe file is organized into a hierarchy of Basins, Stratum, and Grains. A\nGrainId identifies which grain inside of which stratum inside of which basin\nthe data is stored.\nNearly ever header stored in the file will be stored twice. When a new set of\nupdates are being written, new data only touches the outdated copy. There are\nmultiple validations that can happen to ensure that each page touched by a\ncommit was flushed. This design is how Sediment will be able to use a single\nflush operation to persist a batch of writes to disk.\nOnce a GrainId has data, it is immutable. The only two operations that can be\nperformed on a GrainId are: get and archive.\nArchiving a grain will prepare the grain to be reused. Grains are not\nimmediately freed, however. Instead, Sediment assigns each commit a\nSequenceId. Sediment supports a built-in log that could be used to power a\nreplication log. To ensure data is not overwritten before a consumer of the log,\nSediment will allow the user to checkpoint the log to a specific SequenceId.\nOnce the SequenceId of a given archive operation has elapsed, the GrainIds\nwill be marked as free and be able to be reused.\n\n\n\n\n    Will this make BonsaiDb fast again?\n    \n\nI don't expect the result of this to be that BonsaiDb is suddenly faster than\nPostgreSQL. The reason is simple: when I first saw the benchmark results in\nJanuary, it took me a very long time convincing myself the PostgreSQL numbers\nwere correct before I allowed myself to get excited.\nI had never heard that PostgreSQL is slow -- quite the contrary. From my\nunderstanding, if your workload is properly optimized, it's actually a very\nperformant database. I know there are ideas on how to improve its performance,\nbut overall, performance is not usually not people's main complaint with\nPostgreSQL and performance is continually improving with each release.\nI'm not going to be able to achieve anywhere near the numbers reported in\nJanuary -- they were based on truly flawed processes and methodology. But, I'm\nhopeful I can get close enough to other ACID-compliant database engines that\nmost users shouldn't have issues with BonsaiDb's performance moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n    Why not ship what I have?\n    \n\nThe problem with the current set of changes is that they are a complete format\nchange from v0.4.1. While Nebari's format hasn't changed today, BonsaiDb is now\nusing Nebari completely differently. This means that I need to design an upgrade\nprocess to migrate the file format.\nWith my confidence level gaining in my new format's design, I am not very\ntempted to subject users to two format upgrades. While this decision means that\nthese performance updates will take longer to get into users hands, it means\nless legacy code for me to support during the alpha period. At this stage in\nBonsaiDb's development, I have to prioritize maintainability.\n\n\n\n\n    I'm excited\n    \n\nWhile it would have been nice to have been able to work on other features the\nlast few weeks, I'm truly excited by the prospect of this new format. One of the\nbiggest gotchas of benchmarking BonsaiDb (before the recent issues) was the\ncaveat that a \"compact\" operation had to be performed to reclaim disk space.\nWith this new format, there will no longer be that caveat. There will still be\nmaintenance tasks that can be performed to try to optimize storage, but they\nwill be optional and shouldn't be necessary in normal operation.\nI'm simultaneously relieved and excited that I should be able to stick with\nNebari. The changes in my pending view and document storage\nrewrite enable some really cool features:\n\nWhen indexing a view, Nebari's B+Tree now embeds a the view's reduced value at\neach B+Tree node. This will enable reduce queries across ranges to be\noptimized and not require accessing as much data when computing the results.\nDocument revisions are now based on Nebari's SequenceId. This change opens the\npath for exposing full document revision history, including a list of every\nchange across the entire collection -- a feature Nebari supported but BonsaiDb\ndid not have a way to expose efficiently.\n\nNebari's ability to embed your own indexes in the B+Tree nodes and create custom\ntree roots make it a unique low-level database offering.\n\n\n\n\n    What's next?\n    \n\nThis post and the last post provide a good summary of what I've been up to for\nthe past month, so I'm skipping a \"This Month in BonsaiDb\" post for May. If I\ndon't have any news before the end of June rolls around, I'll make sure to write\nan update covering my progress.\nIn the meantime, if you'd like to try the current alpha of BonsaiDb, the\nhomepage has basic setup instructions and a list of\nexamples. I have started writing a user's\nguide, but I think the\ndocumentation is in a better state at the moment.\nThank you again to everyone who took the time to write a note after last week's\nblog post. I'm thankful to be part of such a supportive community.\n","id":"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/optimizing-bonsaidb-p1/","title":"Optimizing BonsaiDb: Improving Transaction Batching (Part 1 of ?)"}},"docInfo":{"https://bonsaidb.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bonsaidb.io/about/":{"body":644,"title":1},"https://bonsaidb.io/benchmarks/":{"body":460,"title":2},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/":{"body":2,"title":2},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/announcing-bonsaidb-alpha/":{"body":630,"title":7},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/april-2022-update/":{"body":1139,"title":6},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/bonsaidb-v0-2-0/":{"body":368,"title":7},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/bonsaidb-v0-3-0/":{"body":392,"title":7},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/bonsaidb-v0-4-0/":{"body":993,"title":6},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/commerce-benchmark/":{"body":448,"title":4},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/durable-writes/":{"body":2103,"title":7},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/february-2022-update/":{"body":1148,"title":6},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/january-2022-update/":{"body":676,"title":6},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/one-year-anniversary/":{"body":1129,"title":5},"https://bonsaidb.io/blog/optimizing-bonsaidb-p1/":{"body":1246,"title":7}},"length":15},"lang":"English"};
