Our [homepage](https://bonsaidb.io/) has basic setup instructions and a list of examples. We have started writing a [user's guide](https://dev.bonsaidb.io/v0.2.0/guide/), and we have tried to write [good documentation](https://docs.rs/bonsaidb/).

We would love to hear from you if you have questions or feedback. We have [community Discourse forums](https://community.khonsulabs.com/) and a [Discord server](https://discord.khonsulabs.com), but also welcome anyone to [open an issue](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/issues/new) with any questions or feedback.

We dream big with [BonsaiDb][bonsaidb], and we believe that it can simplify writing and deploying complex, data-driven applications in Rust. We would love [additional contributors](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/labels/good%20first%20issue) who have similar passions and ambitions.

Lastly, if you build something with one of our libraries, we would love to hear about it. Nothing makes us happier than hearing people are building things with our crates!
