While we're working towards our first alpha, I've been trying to anticipate
questions potential users might have when looking at BonsaiDb for the first
time. While we are keeping the alpha label, we are hoping to find some
adventurous users who are excited at the vision of a programmable database
written in Rust.

One obvious question that almost everyone will ask at some point when hearing
about a new database: **how does it perform?**

BonsaiDb is a unique database. It is best described as a [NoSQL][nosql]
database, but traditionally NoSQL databases tend to favor eventual consistency
and speed over ACID compliance. When starting this project, I specifically
wanted to have all the guarantees PostgreSQL makes, but easier to use and deploy
than PostgreSQL.

Until this past week, I knew from previous benchmarks that [Nebari][nebari], our
underlying storage layer, was [pretty fast][nebari-benches], but I had no real
indicator of how BonsaiDb would perform relative to PostgreSQL.

## Designing a Benchmark Suite

I had three different parameters I wanted to measure:

- Dataset size
- Amount of concurrent workers
- Read-heavy vs Write-heavy workloads

I came up with the idea to make a benchmark inspired by the types of operations
a database for a commerce website. The basic idea is to generate an initial data
set, a list of plans for agents to execute, and test the dataset and plans using
different amounts of concurrency. The operations currently supported are:

- Lookup product by id
- Find product by name (exact match)
- Create shopping cart
- Add product to cart
- Checkout
- Review a product

A single plan is generated by using probabilities to adjust how many plans
succeed in each step of the shopping process. Some plans will search for
products and never add them to a cart. Others will not only purchase the
product, but also write a review. By adjusting the probabilities of each action
occurring, we create a funnel that allows us to adjust the ratio of reads and
writes.

I've written some more notes on the implementation of the benchmark itself, such
as how ratings aggregation is handled, in the [benchmark's
README][commerce-bench].

## BonsaiDb is faster than I had hoped

This set of graphs is from the "large, write-heavy, 2 agents per core"
benchmark, run on a [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com) on a GP1-XS instance
running Ubuntu 20.04 with 4 CPU cores, 16GB of RAM, and local NVME storage. The
[entire suite's results][commerce-results] can be viewed as well. To summarize,
if you sum the total wall time of BonsaiDb via WebSockets and the PosgreSQL
version, you'll see that BonsaiDb took 2 minutes 36 seconds to complete, and
PostgreSQL took 24 minutes 48 seconds, ranging between 46% and 94% faster.

As I started seeing results, I was simply blown away. I've tried to be [as fair
as possible][commerce-bench] in writing this benchmark. Over time I plan on
adding additional database backends for comparison, as well as additional
operations as BonsaiDb gains more features.

One benefit that PostgreSQL has is that it has its own query language.
Currently, the only way to get a customized result back is to create a
[View][view]. This is why I often refer to BonsaiDb as a *programmable
database*. The interface for accessing your data is how you design it. I've been
dreaming up ideas on how to approach a query language, but to me it's a much
lower priority to me than replication and clustering.

## Trying out BonsaiDb

BonsaiDb is currently labeled experimental. We are working to stabilize
[custodian-password][custodian]'s storage format in preparation for providing
cross-version support. After that is done, we are going to label BonsaiDb as
alpha. It hasn't been used by many people yet, so we expect that there will be
bugs and some of those bugs might even cause loss of data. That being said,
we've been using it ourselves with [KhonsuLabs.com](https://khonsulabs.com/)
since early November with no issues, in addition to a couple other small test
projects.

We encourage most users to wait another week or two until we have the alpha on
Crates.io, but for those looking to play with something new, we'd love any
feedback from early users. We've already made countless improvements to the API,
[documentation][bonsaidb-docs], [user's guide][bonsaidb-guide] and [examples][bonsaidb-examples] as a result of questions from early adopters.

If you're interested in BonsaiDb but want to wait until we've released a stable version, we invite you to subscribe to [this site's feed](/blog/atom.xml) or watch the [repository's releases section][bonsaidb-releases].
