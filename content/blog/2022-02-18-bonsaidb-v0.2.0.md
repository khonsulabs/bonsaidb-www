> **What is BonsaiDb?**
>
> [BonsaiDb][bonsaidb] is a new database aiming to be the most developer-friendly
> Rust database. BonsaiDb has a unique feature set geared at solving many common
> data problems. We have a page dedicated to answering the question: [What is
> BonsaiDb?](https://bonsaidb.io/about).

I'm excited to announce [v0.2.0][release], which brings two major features in
addition to many small improvements and fixes. There are API-level changes that
are potentially breaking changes. The [CHANGELOG][changelog] should help navigate through the changes
necessary to update your projects.

## {{ anchor(text = "Custom Primary Keys") }}

One design decision that was made early in BonsaiDb's development was to use a
u64 as the unique id/primary key for all documents. This was largely done to
simplify the API, and I felt like it was reasonable that users could create an
alternate key using a [unique view][view-unique].

I've attempted twice before to change it to allow customizing the primary key,
but each time I ended up reverting the changes as I didn't like the impact to
the API. However, this time I've succeeded in adding this API with minimal
impact to the high-level API.

Our [new example][primary-keys-example] demonstrates how this feature can be
used with the `Collection` derive macro:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Collection, Eq, PartialEq)]
#[collection(name = "multi-key", primary_key = (u32, u64))]
struct MultiKey {
    value: String,
}

async fn test<C: Connection>(db: C) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let inserted = MultiKey {
        value: String::from("hello"),
    }
    .insert_into((42, 64), &db)
    .await?;
    let retrieved = MultiKey::get((42, 64), &db)
        .await?
        .expect("document not found");
}
```

The way this is implemented, any type that implements [`Key` trait][key] and
isn't too large can be used as a primary key. The current size limitation is
purely for optimization, and may be relaxed in the future.

More information about this feature can be found [in our user guide][primary-keys-guide].

## {{ anchor(text = "LZ4 Compression") }}

A potential user was originally trying to diagnose why BonsaiDb was creating
larger databases than Sled. After some troubleshooting, it was discovered that
they had enabled the `zstd` feature in Sled, enabling automatic compression of
data being stored.

This was a feature I had already planned on supporting, although my research had
led me to believe that LZ4 was a better choice for an algorithm. Without doing
comparative benchmarking personally, I decided to start with LZ4 compression and
[add `zstd` once namespaced features are released in Rust][zstd-compression].

Some benchmarks have been updated to include compression for comparision. The
results are interesting to look at, but no serious comparisons should be drawn
yet. If you are under tight space constraints, this feature can save a lot of
storage space while not impacting performance in a major way.

As you can see in this graph, the [Commerce
Benchmark](https://dev.bonsaidb.io/v0.2.0/benchmarks/commerce/) sometimes shows
improved performance over the uncompressed version. As always, performance will
depend on your hardware and operating environment, which is why this is an
opt-in feature.

The user who originally asked about this feature had reported that BonsaiDb's
uncompressed database size a staggering 30x larger than the equivalent data in
Sled. The next day they were able to test a branch with the feature enabled. The
BonsaiDb database compressed with LZ4 shrunk to under half the size of their
Sled database.

## {{ anchor(text = "Getting Started") }}

Our [homepage](https://bonsaidb.io/) has basic setup instructions and a list of examples. We have started writing a [user's guide](https://dev.bonsaidb.io/v0.2.0/guide/), and we have tried to write [good documentation](https://docs.rs/bonsaidb/).

We would love to hear from you if you have questions or feedback. We have [community Discourse forums](https://community.khonsulabs.com/) and a [Discord server](https://discord.khonsulabs.com), but also welcome anyone to [open an issue](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/issues/new) with any questions or feedback.

We dream big with [BonsaiDb][bonsaidb], and we believe that it can simplify writing and deploying complex, data-driven applications in Rust. We would love [additional contributors](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/labels/good%20first%20issue) who have similar passions and ambitions.

Lastly, if you build something with one of our libraries, we would love to hear about it. Nothing makes us happier than hearing people are building things with our crates!
